    "As discussed in the textbook and from common knowledge the list above makes it clear that some suffixes have more than one letter that can be suggestive of name genders. For example, names ending in `ie` appear to be mislabeled. The same can be said about prefixes as well. For example, names starting with `Do` is mostly female. Also, names starting with `Je` is generally males in the error list. "
