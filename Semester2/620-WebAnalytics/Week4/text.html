</div>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 1</h3>

<p class='c010'>The cat is the offspring of a cat and the dog
of a dog, but butlers and lady’s maids do not
reproduce their kind. They have other duties.</p>

<p class='c011'>So their successors have to be sought among
the prolific, and particularly among the prolific
on great estates. Such are gardeners, but not
under-gardeners, gamekeepers, and coachmen—but
not lodge people, because their years are too
great and their lodges too small. And among
those to whom this opportunity of entering service
came was young Bealby, who was the stepson
of Mr. Darling, the gardener of Shonts.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everyone knows the glories of Shonts. Its
façade. Its two towers. The great marble pond.
The terraces where the peacocks walk and the
lower lake with the black and white swans. The
great park and the avenue. The view of the
river winding away across the blue country.
And of the Shonts Velasquez—but that is now
in America. And the Shonts Rubens, which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>in the National Gallery. And the Shonts porcelain.
And the Shonts past history; it was a
refuge for the old faith; it had priest’s holes and
secret passages. And how at last the Marquis
had to let Shonts to the Laxtons—the Peptonized
Milk and Baby Soother people—for a
long term of years. It was a splendid chance for
any boy to begin his knowledge of service in so
great an establishment, and only the natural
perversity of human nature can explain the violent
objection young Bealby took to anything of the
sort. He did. He said he did not want to be a
servant, and that he would not go and be a good
boy and try his very best in that state of life to
which it had pleased God to call him at Shonts.
On the contrary.</p>

<p class='c011'>He communicated these views suddenly to his
mother as she was preparing a steak and kidney
pie in the bright little kitchen of the gardener’s
cottage. He came in with his hair all ruffled and
his face hot and distinctly dirty, and his hands
in his trousers pockets in the way he had been
repeatedly told not to.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother,” he said, “I’m not going to be a
steward’s boy at the house anyhow, not if you
tell me to, not till you’re blue in the face. So
that’s all about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This delivered, he remained panting, having no
further breath left in him.</p>

<p class='c011'>His mother was a thin firm woman. She
paused in her rolling of the dough until he had
finished, and then she made a strong broadening
sweep of the rolling pin, and remained facing him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>leaning forward on that implement with her head
a little on one side.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will do,” she said, “whatsoever your
father has said you will do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’E isn’t my father,” said young Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>His mother gave a snapping nod of the head
expressive of extreme determination.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anyhow I ain’t going to do it,” said young
Bealby, and feeling the conversation was difficult
to sustain he moved towards the staircase door
with a view to slamming it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ll do it,” said his mother, “right enough.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You see whether I do,” said young Bealby,
and then got in his door-slam rather hurriedly
because of steps outside.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Darling came in out of the sunshine a few
moments later. He was a large, many-pocketed,
earthy-whiskered man with a clean-shaven determined
mouth, and he carried a large pale
cucumber in his hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I tole him,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What did he say?” asked his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nuthin’,” said Mr. Darling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’E says ’e won’t,” said Mrs. Darling.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Darling regarded her thoughtfully for a
moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never see such a boy,” said Mr. Darling.
“Why—’e’s <em>got</em> to.”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 2</h3>

<p class='c010'>But young Bealby maintained an obstinate
fight against the inevitable.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had no gift of lucid exposition. “I ain’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>going to be a servant,” he said. “I don’t see what
right people have making a servant of me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You got to be something,” said Mr. Darling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everybody’s got to be something,” said Mrs.
Darling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then let me be something else,” said young
Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>I</em> dessay you’d like to be a gentleman,” said
Mr. Darling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wouldn’t mind,” said young Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You got to be what your opportunities give
you,” said Mr. Darling.</p>

<p class='c011'>Young Bealby became breathless. “Why
shouldn’t I be an engine driver?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All oily,” said his mother. “And getting
yourself killed in an accident. And got to pay
fines. You’d <em>like</em> to be an engine driver.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Or a soldier.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oo!—a Swaddy!” said Mr. Darling decisively.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Or the sea.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“With that weak stummik of yours,” said Mrs.
Darling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Besides which,” said Mr. Darling, “it’s been
arranged for you to go up to the ’ouse the very
first of next month. And your box and everything
ready.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Young Bealby became very red in the face.
“I won’t go,” he said very faintly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will,” said Mr. Darling, “if I ’ave to
take you by the collar and the slack of your
breeches to get you there.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>
  <div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 3</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The heart of young Bealby was a coal of fire
within his breast as—unassisted—he went
across the dewy park up to the great house,
whither his box was to follow him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He thought the world a “rotten show.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He also said, apparently to two does and a
fawn, “If you think I’m going to stand it, you
know, you’re <b><span class='fss'>JOLLY</span></b>-well mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I do not attempt to justify his prejudice against
honourable usefulness in a domestic capacity.
He had it. Perhaps there is something in the
air of Highbury, where he had spent the past
eight years of his life, that leads to democratic
ideals. It is one of those new places where estates
seem almost forgotten. Perhaps too there
was something in the Bealby strain....</p>

<p class='c011'>I think he would have objected to any employment
at all. Hitherto he had been a remarkably
free boy with a considerable gusto about his freedom.
Why should that end? The little village
mixed school had been a soft job for his Cockney
wits, and for a year and a half he had been top
boy. Why not go on being top boy?</p>

<p class='c011'>Instead of which, under threats, he had to go
across the sunlit corner of the park, through
that slanting morning sunlight which had been
so often the prelude to golden days of leafy wanderings!
He had to go past the corner of the
laundry where he had so often played cricket
with the coachman’s boys (already swallowed
up into the working world), he had to follow the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>laundry wall to the end of the kitchen, and there,
where the steps go down and underground, he
had to say farewell to the sunlight, farewell to
childhood, boyhood, freedom. He had to go down
and along the stone corridor to the pantry, and
there he had to ask for Mr. Mergleson. He
paused on the top step and looked up at the blue
sky across which a hawk was slowly drifting.
His eyes followed the hawk out of sight beyond a
cypress bough, but indeed he was not thinking
about the hawk, he was not seeing the hawk;
he was struggling with a last wild impulse of his
ferial nature. “Why not sling it?” his ferial
nature was asking. “Why not even now—<em>do
a bunk</em>?”</p>

<p class='c011'>It would have been better for him perhaps
and better for Mr. Mergleson and better for
Shonts if he had yielded to the whisper of the
Tempter. But his heart was heavy within him,
and he had no lunch. And never a penny. One
can do but a very little bunk on an empty belly!
“Must” was written all over him. He went down
the steps.</p>

<p class='c011'>The passage was long and cool and at the end
of it was a swing door. Through that and then
to the left, he knew one had to go, past the stillroom
and so to the pantry. The maids were at
breakfast in the stillroom with the door open.
The grimace he made in passing was intended
rather to entertain than to insult, and anyhow a
chap must do something with his face. And then
he came to the pantry and into the presence of
Mr. Mergleson.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Mr. Mergleson was in his shirt-sleeves and
generally dishevelled, having an early cup of tea
in an atmosphere full of the bleak memories of
overnight. He was an ample man with a large
nose, a vast under lip and mutton-chop side-whiskers.
His voice would have suited a succulent
parrot. He took out a gold watch from his waistcoat
pocket and regarded it. “Ten minutes past
seven, young man,” he said, “isn’t seven o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Young Bealby made no articulate answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just stand there for a minute,” said Mr.
Mergleson, “and when I’m at libbuty I’ll run
through your duties.” And almost ostentatiously
he gave himself up to the enjoyment of
his cup of tea.</p>

<p class='c011'>Three other gentlemen in deshabille sat at
table with Mr. Mergleson. They regarded young
Bealby with attention, and the youngest, a red-haired,
barefaced youth in shirt-sleeves and a
green apron was moved to a grimace that was
clearly designed to echo the scowl on young
Bealby’s features.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fury that had been subdued by a momentary
awe of Mr. Mergleson revived and gathered
force. Young Bealby’s face became scarlet, his
eyes filled with tears and his mind with the need
for movement. After all,—he wouldn’t stand it.
He turned round abruptly and made for the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where’n earth you going to?” cried Mr.
Mergleson.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’s shy!” cried the second footman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Steady on!” cried the first footman and had
him by the shoulder in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>“Lemme <em>go</em>!” howled the new recruit, struggling.
“I won’t be a blooming servant. I won’t.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here!” cried Mr. Mergleson, gesticulating
with his teaspoon, “bring ’im to the end of the
table there. What’s this about a blooming
servant?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby, suddenly blubbering, was replaced at
the end of the table.</p>

<p class='c011'>“May I ask what’s this about a blooming servant?”
asked Mr. Mergleson.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sniff and silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did I understand you to say that you ain’t
going to be a blooming servant, young Bealby?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said young Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thomas,” said Mr. Mergleson, “just smack
’is ’ed. Smack it rather ’ard....”</p>

<p class='c011'>Things too rapid to relate occurred. “So
you’d <em>bite</em>, would you?” said Thomas....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” said Mr. Mergleson. “<em>Got</em> ’im! That
one!” ...</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just smack ’is ’ed once more,” said Mr.
Mergleson....</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now you just stand there, young man,
until I’m at libbuty to attend to you further,”
said Mr. Mergleson, and finished his tea slowly
and eloquently....</p>

<p class='c011'>The second footman rubbed his shin thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I got to smack ’is ’ed much,” he said, “’e’d
better change into his slippers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take him to ’is room,” said Mr. Mergleson
getting up. “See ’e washes the grief and grubbiness
off ’is face in the handwash at the end of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the passage and make him put on his slippers.
Then show ’im ’ow to lay the table in the steward’s
room.”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 4</h3>

<p class='c010'>The duties to which Bealby was introduced
struck him as perplexingly various, undesirably
numerous, uninteresting and difficult to remember,
and also he did not try to remember them very
well because he wanted to do them as badly as
possible and he thought that forgetting would be
a good way of starting at that. He was beginning
at the bottom of the ladder; to him it fell to wait
on the upper servants, and the green baize door
at the top of the service staircase was the limit
of his range. His room was a small wedge-shaped
apartment under some steps leading to the servants’
hall, lit by a window that did not open and
that gave upon the underground passage. He
received his instructions in a state of crumpled
mutinousness, but for a day his desire to be remarkably
impossible was more than counterbalanced
by his respect for the large able hands of
the four man-servants, his seniors, and by a disinclination
to be returned too promptly to the
gardens. Then in a tentative manner he broke
two plates and got his head smacked by Mr.
Mergleson himself. Mr. Mergleson gave a staccato
slap quite as powerful as Thomas’s but otherwise
different. The hand of Mr. Mergleson was
large and fat and he got his effects by dash,
Thomas’s was horny and lingered. After that
young Bealby put salt in the teapot in which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>housekeeper made tea. But that he observed she
washed out with hot water before she put in the
tea. It was clear that he had wasted his salt,
which ought to have gone into the kettle.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next time,—the kettle.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond telling him his duties almost excessively
nobody conversed with young Bealby during the
long hours of his first day in service. At midday
dinner in the servants’ hall, he made one of the
kitchen-maids giggle by pulling faces intended
to be delicately suggestive of Mr. Mergleson, but
that was his nearest approach to disinterested
human intercourse.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the hour for retirement came,—“Get
out of it. Go to bed, you dirty little Kicker,”
said Thomas. “We’ve had about enough of you
for one day”—young Bealby sat for a long time
on the edge of his bed weighing the possibilities
of arson and poison. He wished he had some
poison. Some sort of poison with a medieval
manner, poison that hurts before it kills. Also
he produced a small penny pocket-book with a
glazed black cover and blue edges. He headed
one page of this “Mergleson” and entered beneath
it three black crosses. Then he opened an
account to Thomas, who was manifestly destined
to be his principal creditor. Bealby was not a
forgiving boy. At the village school they had
been too busy making him a good Churchman to
attend to things like that. There were a lot of
crosses for Thomas.</p>

<p class='c011'>And while Bealby made these sinister memoranda
downstairs Lady Laxton—for Laxton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>had bought a baronetcy for twenty thousand down
to the party funds and a tip to the whip over the
Peptonized Milk flotation—Lady Laxton, a
couple of floors above Bealby’s ruffled head mused
over her approaching week-end party. It was an
important week-end party. The Lord Chancellor
of England was coming. Never before had she
had so much as a member of the Cabinet at Shonts.
He was coming, and do what she would she could
not help but connect it with her very strong desire
to see the master of Shonts in the clear scarlet of
a Deputy Lieutenant. Peter would look so well
in that. The Lord Chancellor was coming, and
to meet him and to circle about him there were
Lord John Woodenhouse and Slinker Bond,
there were the Countess of Barracks and Mrs.
Rampound Pilby, the novelist, with her husband
Rampound Pilby, there was Professor Timbre,
the philosopher, and there were four smaller
(though quite good) people who would run about
very satisfactorily among the others. (At least
she thought they would run about very satisfactorily
amongst the others, not imagining any
evil of her cousin Captain Douglas.)</p>

<p class='c011'>All this good company in Shonts filled Lady
Laxton with a pleasant realization of progressive
successes but at the same time one must confess
that she felt a certain diffidence. In her heart of
hearts she knew she had not made this party.
It had happened to her. How it might go on
happening to her, she did not know, it was beyond
her control. She hoped very earnestly that everything
would pass off well.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>The Lord Chancellor was as big a guest as any
she had had. One must grow as one grows, but
still,—being easy and friendly with him would
be, she knew, a tremendous effort. Rather
like being easy and friendly with an elephant.
She was not good at conversation. The task of
interesting people taxed her and puzzled her....</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Slinker Bond, the whip, who had arranged
the whole business—after, it must be confessed,
a hint from Sir Peter. Laxton had complained
that the government were neglecting this part of
the country. “They ought to show up more than
they do in the county,” said Sir Peter, and added
almost carelessly, “I could easily put anybody up
at Shonts.” There were to be two select dinner
parties and a large but still select Sunday lunch
to let in the countryside to the spectacle of
the Laxtons taking their (new) proper place at
Shonts....</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not only the sense of her own deficiencies
that troubled Lady Laxton; there were also her
husband’s excesses. He had—it was no use disguising
it—rather too much the manner of an
employer. He had a way of getting, how could
one put it?—<em>confident</em> at dinner and Mergleson
seemed to <em>delight</em> in filling up his glass. Then he
would contradict a good deal.... She felt
that Lord Chancellors however are the sort of men
one doesn’t contradict....</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the Lord Chancellor was said to be interested
in philosophy—a difficult subject. She
had got Timbre to talk to him upon that. Timbre
was a professor of philosophy at Oxford, so that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>was sure to be all right. But she wished she knew
one or two good safe things to say in philosophy
herself. She had long felt the need of a secretary,
and now she felt it more than ever. If she had a
secretary, she could just tell him what it was she
wanted to talk about and he could get her one or
two of the right books and mark the best passages
and she could learn it all up.</p>

<p class='c011'>She feared—it was a worrying fear—that
Laxton would say right out and very early in the
week-end that he didn’t believe in philosophy.
He had a way of saying he “didn’t believe in”
large things like that,—art, philanthropy, novels,
and so on. Sometimes he said, “I don’t believe
in all this”—art or whatever it was. She had
watched people’s faces when he had said it and
she had come to the conclusion that saying you
don’t believe in things isn’t the sort of thing people
say nowadays. It was wrong, somehow. But
she did not want to tell Laxton directly that it was
wrong. He would remember if she did, but he had
a way of taking such things rather badly at the
time.... She hated him to take things badly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If one could invent some little hint,” she
whispered to herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had often wished she was better at hints.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was, you see, a gentlewoman, modest,
kindly. Her people were quite good people.
Poor, of course. But she was not clever, she was
anything but clever. And the wives of these
captains of industry need to be very clever indeed
if they are to escape a magnificent social isolation.
They get the titles and the big places and all that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>sort of thing; people don’t at all intend to isolate
them, but there is nevertheless an inadvertent
avoidance....</p>

<p class='c011'>Even as she uttered these words, “If one
could invent some little hint,” Bealby down there
less than forty feet away through the solid floor
below her feet and a little to the right was wetting
his stump of pencil as wet as he could in order to
ensure a sufficiently emphatic fourteenth cross on
the score sheet of the doomed Thomas. Most of
the other thirteen marks were done with such
hard breathing emphasis that the print of them
went more than halfway through that little blue-edged
book.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 5</h3>

<p class='c010'>The arrival of the week-end guests impressed
Bealby at first merely as a blessed influence that
withdrew the four men-servants into that unknown
world on the other side of the green baize door,
but then he learnt that it also involved the appearance
of five new persons, two valets and three
maids, for whom places had to be laid in the
steward’s room. Otherwise Lady Laxton’s social
arrangements had no more influence upon the
mind of Bealby than the private affairs of the
Emperor of China. There was something going
on up there, beyond even his curiosity. All he
heard of it was a distant coming and going of
vehicles and some slight talk to which he was
inattentive while the coachman and grooms were
having a drink in the pantry—until these maids
and valets appeared. They seemed to him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>appear suddenly out of nothing, like slugs after
rain, black and rather shiny, sitting about inactively
and quietly consuming small matters.
He disliked them, and they regarded him without
affection or respect.</p>

<p class='c011'>Who cared? He indicated his feeling towards
them as soon as he was out of the steward’s room
by a gesture of the hand and nose venerable only
by reason of its antiquity.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had things more urgent to think about than
strange valets and maids. Thomas had laid
hands on him, jeered at him, inflicted shameful
indignities on him and he wanted to kill Thomas
in some frightful manner. (But if possible unobtrusively.)</p>

<p class='c011'>If he had been a little Japanese boy, this would
have been an entirely honourable desire. It
would have been Bushido and all that sort of
thing. In the gardener’s stepson however it is—undesirable....</p>

<p class='c011'>Thomas, on the other hand, having remarked
the red light of revenge in Bealby’s eye and being
secretly afraid, felt that his honour was concerned
in not relaxing his persecutions. He called him
“Kicker” and when he did not answer to that
name, he called him “Snorter,” “Bleater,”
“Snooks,” and finally tweaked his ear. Then he
saw fit to assume that Bealby was deaf and that
ear-tweaking was the only available method of
address. This led on to the convention of a sign
language whereby ideas were communicated to
Bealby by means of painful but frequently quite
ingeniously symbolical freedoms with various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>parts of his person. Also Thomas affected to
discover uncleanliness in Bealby’s head and succeeded
after many difficulties in putting it into
a sinkful of lukewarm water.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile young Bealby devoted such scanty
time as he could give to reflection to debating
whether it is better to attack Thomas suddenly
with a carving knife or throw a lighted lamp.
The large pantry inkpot of pewter might be effective
in its way, he thought, but he doubted whether
in the event of a charge it had sufficient stopping
power. He was also curiously attracted by a
long two-pronged toasting-fork that hung at the
side of the pantry fireplace. It had <em>reach</em>....</p>

<p class='c011'>Over all these dark thoughts and ill-concealed
emotions Mr. Mergleson prevailed, large yet
speedy, speedy yet exact, parroting orders and
making plump gestures, performing duties and
seeing that duties were performed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Matters came to a climax late on Saturday
night at the end of a trying day, just before Mr.
Mergleson went round to lock up and turn out
the lights.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thomas came into the pantry close behind
Bealby, who, greatly belated through his own inefficiency,
was carrying a tray of glasses from the
steward’s room, applied an ungentle hand to his
neck, and ruffled up his back hair in a smart and
painful manner. At the same time Thomas remarked,
“Burrrrh!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby stood still for a moment and then put
down his tray on the table and, making peculiar
sounds as he did so, resorted very rapidly to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>toasting fork.... He got a prong into Thomas’s
chin at the first prod.</p>

<p class='c011'>How swift are the changes of the human soul!
At the moment of his thrust young Bealby was a
primordial savage; so soon as he saw this incredible
piercing of Thomas’s chin—for all the
care that Bealby had taken it might just as well
have been Thomas’s eye—he moved swiftly
through the ages and became a simple Christian
child. He abandoned violence and fled.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fork hung for a moment from the visage of
Thomas like a twisted beard of brass, and then
rattled on the ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thomas clapped his hand to his chin and
discovered blood.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You little—!” He never found the right
word (which perhaps is just as well); instead he
started in pursuit of Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby—in his sudden horror of his own act—and
Thomas fled headlong into the passage and
made straight for the service stairs that went up
into a higher world. He had little time to think.
Thomas with a red-smeared chin appeared in
pursuit. Thomas the avenger. Thomas really
roused. Bealby shot through the green baize
door and the pursuing footman pulled up only
just in time not to follow him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Only just in time. He had an instinctive instant
anxious fear of great dangers. He heard something,
a sound as though the young of some very
large animal had squeaked feebly. He had a
glimpse of something black and white—and
large....</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Then something, some glass thing, smashed.</p>

<p class='c011'>He steadied the green baize door which was
wobbling on its brass hinges, controlled his panting
breath and listened.</p>

<p class='c011'>A low rich voice was—ejaculating. It was
not Bealby’s voice, it was the voice of some substantial
person being quietly but deeply angry.
They were the ejaculations restrained in tone but
not in quality of a ripe and well-stored mind,—no
boy’s thin stuff.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then very softly Thomas pushed open the
door—just widely enough to see and as instantly
let it fall back into place.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very gently and yet with an alert rapidity he
turned about and stole down the service stairs.</p>

<p class='c011'>His superior officer appeared in the passage
below.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Mergleson,” he cried, “I say—Mr.
Mergleson.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s up?” said Mr. Mergleson.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’s gone!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bealby.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Home?” This almost hopefully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Up there! I think he ran against somebody.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Mergleson scrutinized his subordinate’s face
for a second. Then he listened intently; both
men listened intently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have to fetch him out of that,” said Mr.
Mergleson, suddenly preparing for brisk activity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thomas bent lower over the banisters.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“<em>The Lord Chancellor!</em>” he whispered with
white lips and a sideways gesture of his head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What about ’im?” said Mergleson, arrested by
something in the manner of Thomas.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thomas’s whisper became so fine that Mr.
Mergleson drew nearer to catch it and put up a
hand to his ear. Thomas repeated the last
remark. “He’s just through there—on the landing—cursing
and swearing—’orrible things—more
like a mad turkey than a human being.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where’s Bealby?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He must almost ’ave run into ’im,” said
Thomas after consideration.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But now—where is he?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thomas pantomimed infinite perplexity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Mergleson reflected and decided upon his
line. He came up the service staircase, lifted his
chin and with an air of meek officiousness went
through the green door. There was no one now
on the landing, there was nothing remarkable
on the landing except a broken tumbler, but half-way
up the grand staircase stood the Lord Chancellor.
Under one arm the great jurist carried a
soda water syphon and he grasped a decanter of
whisky in his hand. He turned sharply at the
sound of the green baize door and bent upon Mr.
Mergleson the most terrible eyebrows that ever,
surely! adorned a legal visage. He was very red
in the face and savage-looking.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was it <em>you</em>,” he said with a threatening gesture
of the decanter, and his voice betrayed a
noble indignation, “Was it <em>you</em> who slapped me
behind?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“Slapped you behind, me lord??”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Slapped me <em>behind</em>. Don’t I speak—plainly?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—such a libbuty, me lord!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Idiot! I ask you a plain question—”</p>

<p class='c011'>With almost inconceivable alacrity Mr. Mergleson
rushed up three steps, leapt forward and
caught the syphon as it slipped from his lordship’s
arm.</p>

<p class='c011'>He caught it, but at a price. He overset and,
clasping it in his hands, struck his lordship first
with the syphon on the left shin and then butted
him with a face that was still earnestly respectful
in the knees. His lordship’s legs were driven
sideways, so that they were no longer beneath his
centre of gravity. With a monosyllabic remark
of a topographical nature his lordship collapsed
upon Mr. Mergleson. The decanter flew out of
his grasp and smashed presently with emphasis
upon the landing below. The syphon, escaping
from the wreckage of Mr. Mergleson and drawn no
doubt by a natural affinity, rolled noisily from
step to step in pursuit of the decanter....</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a curious little procession that hurried
down the great staircase of Shonts that night.
First the whisky like a winged harbinger with the
pedestrian syphon in pursuit. Then the great
lawyer gripping the great butler by the tails of
his coat and punching furiously. Then Mr.
Mergleson trying wildly to be respectful—even
in disaster. First the Lord Chancellor dived over
Mr. Mergleson, grappling as he passed, then Mr.
Mergleson, attempting explanations, was pulled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>backwards over the Lord Chancellor; then again
the Lord Chancellor was for a giddy but vindictive
moment uppermost; a second rotation and they
reached the landing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bang! There was a deafening report—</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>A WEEK-END AT SHONTS</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 1</h3>

<p class='c010'>The week-end visit is a form of entertainment
peculiar to Great Britain. It is a thing that could
have been possible only in a land essentially aristocratic
and mellow, in which even the observance
of the sabbath has become mellow. At every
London terminus on a Saturday afternoon the
outgoing trains have an unusually large proportion
of first class carriages, and a peculiar abundance
of rich-looking dressing-bags provoke the covetous
eye. A discreet activity of valets and maids
mingles with the stimulated alertness of the
porters. One marks celebrities in gay raiment.
There is an indefinable air of distinction upon
platform and bookstall. Sometimes there are
carriages reserved for especially privileged parties.
There are greetings.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And so <em>you</em> are coming too!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, this time it is Shonts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The place where they found the Rubens. Who
<em>has</em> it now?” ...</p>

<p class='c011'>Through this cheerfully prosperous throng
went the Lord Chancellor with his high nose,
those eyebrows of his which he seemed to be able
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>to furl or unfurl at will and his expression of
tranquil self-sufficiency. He was going to Shonts
for his party and not for his pleasure, but there
was no reason why that should appear upon his
face. He went along preoccupied, pretending to
see nobody, leaving to others the disadvantage of
the greeting. In his right hand he carried a
small important bag of leather. Under his left
arm he bore a philosophical work by Doctor
MacTaggart, three illustrated papers, the <cite>Fortnightly
Review</cite>, the day’s <cite>Times</cite>, the <cite>Hibbert
Journal</cite>, <cite>Punch</cite> and two blue books. His Lordship
never quite knew the limits set to what he
could carry under his arm. His man, Candler,
followed therefore at a suitable distance with
several papers that had already been dropped,
alert to retrieve any further losses.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the large bookstall they passed close by Mrs.
Rampound Pilby who, according to her custom,
was feigning to be a member of the general public
and was asking the clerk about her last book.
The Lord Chancellor saw Rampound Pilby hovering
at hand and deftly failed to catch his eye. He
loathed the Rampound Pilbys. He speculated
for a moment what sort of people could possibly
stand Mrs. Pilby’s vast pretensions—even from
Saturday to Monday. One dinner party on her
right hand had glutted him for life. He chose a
corner seat, took possession of both it and the
seat opposite it in order to have somewhere to
put his feet, left Candler to watch over and pack in
his hand luggage and went high up the platform,
remaining there with his back to the world—rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>like a bigger more aquiline Napoleon—in
order to evade the great novelist.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this he was completely successful.</p>

<p class='c011'>He returned however to find Candler on the
verge of a personal conflict with a very fair young
man in grey. He was so fair as to be almost an
albino, except that his eyes were quick and brown;
he was blushing the brightest pink and speaking
very quickly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These two places,” said Candler, breathless
with the badness of his case, “are engaged.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh ve-<em>very</em> well,” said the very fair young man
with his eyebrows and moustache looking very
pale by contrast, “have it so. But do permit me
to occupy the middle seat of the carriage. With
a residuary interest in the semi-gentleman’s place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You little know, young man, <em>whom</em> you are
calling a semi-gentleman,” said Candler, whose
speciality was grammar.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here he is!” said the young gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which place will you have, my Lord?”
asked Candler, abandoning his case altogether.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Facing,” said the Lord Chancellor slowly unfurling
the eyebrows and scowling at the young
man in grey.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I’ll have the other,” said the very fair
young man talking very glibly. He spoke with
a quick low voice, like one who forces himself
to keep going. “You see,” he said, addressing
the great jurist with the extreme familiarity of
the courageously nervous, “I’ve gone into this
sort of thing before. First, mind you, I have a far
look for a vacant corner. I’m not the sort to spoil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>sport. But if there isn’t a vacant corner I look
for traces of a semi-gentleman. A semi-gentleman
is one who has a soft cap and not an umbrella—his
friend in the opposite seat has the umbrella—or
he has an umbrella and not a soft cap, or a waterproof
and not a bag, or a bag and not a waterproof.
And a half interest in a rug. That’s what I call
a semi-gentleman. You see the idea. Sort of
divided beggar. Nothing in any way offensive.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir,” said the Lord Chancellor, interrupting
in a voice of concentrated passion, “I don’t care
a <em>rap</em> what you call a semi-gentleman. <em>Will</em>
you get out of my way?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just as you please,” said the very fair young
gentleman, and going a few paces from the carriage
door he whistled for the boy with the papers.
He was bearing up bravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Pink ’un?</em>” said the very fair young gentleman
almost breathlessly. “<cite>Black and White.</cite>
What’s all these others? <cite>Athenæum?</cite> <cite>Sporting
and Dramatic?</cite> Right O. And—Eh! What?
Do I <em>look</em> the sort that buys a <cite>Spectator</cite>? You
don’t know! My dear boy, where’s your <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savoir
faire</span></i>?”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 2</h3>

<p class='c010'>The Lord Chancellor was a philosopher and not
easily perturbed. His severe manner was consciously
assumed and never much more than skin-deep.
He had already furled his eyebrows and
dismissed his vis-a-vis from his mind before the
train started. He turned over the <cite>Hibbert Journal</cite>,
and read in it with a large tolerance.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Dimly on the outskirts of his consciousness
the very fair young man hovered, as a trifling
annoyance, as something pink and hot rustling
a sheet of a discordant shade of pink, as something
that got in the way of his legs and whistled softly
some trivial cheerful air, just to show how little it
cared. Presently, very soon, this vague trouble
would pass out of his consciousness altogether....</p>

<p class='c011'>The Lord Chancellor was no mere amateur of
philosophy. His activities in that direction were
a part of his public reputation. He lectured on
religion and æsthetics. He was a fluent Hegelian.
He spent his holidays, it was understood, in the
Absolute—at any rate in Germany. He would
sometimes break into philosophy at dinner tables
and particularly over the desert and be more luminously
incomprehensible while still apparently
sober, than almost anyone. An article in the
Hibbert caught and held his attention. It attempted
to define a new and doubtful variety of
Infinity. You know, of course, that there are
many sorts and species of Infinity, and that the
Absolute is just the king among Infinities as the
lion is king among the Beasts....</p>

<p class='c011'>“I say,” said a voice coming out of the world of
Relativity and coughing the cough of those who
break a silence, “you aren’t going to Shonts, are
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Lord Chancellor returned slowly to earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just seen your label,” said the very fair young
man. “You see,—<em>I’m</em> going to Shonts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Lord Chancellor remained outwardly serene.
He reflected for a moment. And then he fell into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>that snare which is more fatal to great lawyers
and judges perhaps than to any other class of
men, the snare of the crushing repartee. One
had come into his head now,—a beauty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then we shall meet there,” he said in his
suavest manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well—rather.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would be a great pity,” said the Lord Chancellor
with an effective blandness, using a kind
of wry smile that he employed to make things
humorous, “it would be a great pity, don’t you
think, to anticipate that pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And having smiled the retort well home with
his head a little on one side, he resumed with
large leisurely movements the reading of his
<cite>Hibbert Journal</cite>.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Got me there,” said the very fair young man
belatedly, looking boiled to a turn, and after a
period of restlessness settled down to an impatient
perusal of <cite>Black and White</cite>.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s a whole blessed week-end of course,”
the young man remarked presently without looking
up from his paper and apparently pursuing some
obscure meditations....</p>

<p class='c011'>A vague uneasiness crept into the Lord Chancellor’s
mind as he continued to appear to peruse.
Out of what train of thought could such a remark
arise? His weakness for crushing retort had a
little betrayed him....</p>

<p class='c011'>It was, however, only when he found himself
upon the platform of Chelsome, which as everyone
knows is the station for Shonts, and discovered
Mr. and Mrs. Rampound Pilby upon the platform,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>looking extraordinarily like a national monument
and its custodian, that the Lord Chancellor,
began to realize that he was in the grip of fate,
and that the service he was doing his party by
week-ending with the Laxtons was likely to be not
simply joyless but disagreeable.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, anyhow, he had MacTaggart, and he could
always work in his own room....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 3</h3>

<p class='c010'>By the end of dinner the Lord Chancellor was
almost at the end of his large but clumsy endurance;
he kept his eyebrows furled only by the most
strenuous relaxation of his muscles, and within
he was a sea of silent blasphemies. All sorts of
little things had accumulated....</p>

<p class='c011'>He exercised an unusual temperance with the
port and old brandy his host pressed upon him,
feeling that he dared not relax lest his rage had its
way with him. The cigars were quite intelligent
at any rate, and he smoked and listened with a
faintly perceptible disdain to the conversation of
the other men. At any rate Mrs. Rampound
Pilby was out of the room. The talk had arisen
out of a duologue that had preceded the departure
of the ladies, a duologue of Timbre’s, about apparitions
and the reality of the future life. Sir
Peter Laxton, released from the eyes of his wife,
was at liberty to say he did not believe in all this
stuff; it was just thought transference and fancy
and all that sort of thing. His declaration did
not arrest the flow of feeble instances and experiences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>into which such talk invariably degenerates.
His Lordship remained carelessly attentive, his
eyebrows unfurled but drooping, his cigar upward
at an acute angle; he contributed no anecdotes,
content now and then to express himself compactly
by some brief sentence of pure Hegelian—much
as a Mahometan might spit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why! come to that, they say Shonts is
haunted,” said Sir Peter. “I suppose we could
have a ghost here in no time if I chose to take it on.
Rare place for a ghost, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The very fair young man of the train had got
a name now and was Captain Douglas. When
he was not blushing too brightly he was rather
good looking. He was a distant cousin of Lady
Laxton’s. He impressed the Lord Chancellor as
unabashed. He engaged people in conversation
with a cheerful familiarity that excluded only
the Lord Chancellor, and even at the Lord Chancellor
he looked ever and again. He pricked up
his ears at the mention of ghosts, and afterwards
when the Lord Chancellor came to think things
over, it seemed to him that he had caught a
curious glance of the Captain’s bright little brown
eye.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What sort of ghost, Sir Peter? Chains? Eh?
No?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing of that sort, it seems. I don’t know
much about it, I wasn’t sufficiently interested.
No, sort of spook that bangs about and does you
a mischief. What’s its name? Plundergeist?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poltergeist,” the Lord Chancellor supplied
carelessly in the pause.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“Runs its hand over your hair in the dark.
Taps your shoulder. All nonsense. But we
don’t tell the servants. Sort of thing I don’t believe
in. Easily explained,—what with panelling
and secret passages and priests’ holes and all that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Priests’ holes!” Douglas was excited.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where they hid. Perfect rabbit warren.
There’s one going out from the drawing-room
alcove. Quite a good room in its way. But you
know,”—a note of wrath crept into Sir Peter’s
voice,—“they didn’t treat me fairly about
these priests’ holes. I ought to have had a sketch
and a plan of these priests’ holes. When a chap
is given possession of a place, he ought to be given
possession. Well! I don’t know where half of
them are myself. That’s not possession. Else
we might refurnish them and do them up a bit.
I guess they’re pretty musty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Douglas spoke with his eye on the Lord
Chancellor. “Sure there isn’t a murdered priest
in the place, Sir Peter?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing of the sort,” said Sir Peter. “I don’t
believe in these priests’ holes. Half of ’em
never had priests in ’em. It’s all pretty tidy
rot I expect—come to the bottom of it....”</p>

<p class='c011'>The conversation did not get away from ghosts
and secret passages until the men went to the
drawing-room. If it seemed likely to do so Captain
Douglas pulled it back. He seemed to delight
in these silly particulars; the sillier they were
the more he was delighted.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Lord Chancellor was a little preoccupied
by one of those irrational suspicions that will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>sometimes afflict the most intelligent of men.
Why did Douglas want to know all the particulars
about the Shonts ghosts? Why every now and
then did he glance with that odd expression at
one’s face,—a glance half appealing and half
amused. Amused! It was a strange fancy,
but the Lord Chancellor could almost have sworn
that the young man was laughing at him. At
dinner he had had that feeling one has at times
of being talked about; he had glanced along the
table to discover the Captain and a rather plain
woman, that idiot Timbre’s wife she probably
was, with their heads together looking up at him
quite definitely and both manifestly pleased by
something Douglas was telling her....</p>

<p class='c011'>What was it Douglas had said in the train?
Something like a threat. But the exact words
had slipped the Lord Chancellor’s memory....</p>

<p class='c011'>The Lord Chancellor’s preoccupation was just
sufficient to make him a little unwary. He
drifted into grappling distance of Mrs. Rampound
Pilby. Her voice caught him like a lasso and
drew him in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, and <em>how</em> is Lord Moggeridge now?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>What on earth is one to say to such an impertinence?</p>

<p class='c011'>She was always like that. She spoke to a man
of the calibre of Lord Bacon as though she was
speaking to a schoolboy home for the holidays.
She had an invincible air of knowing all through
everybody. It gave rather confidence to her work
than charm to her manner.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“Do you still go on with your philosophy?”
she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” shouted the Lord Chancellor, losing all
self-control for the moment and waving his eyebrows
about madly, “no, I go <em>off</em> with it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For your vacations? Ah, Lord Moggeridge,
how I envy you great lawyers your long vacations.
<em>I</em>—never get a vacation. Always we poor
authors are pursued by our creations, sometimes
it’s typescript, sometimes it’s proofs. Not that
I really complain of proofs. I confess to a weakness
for proofs. Sometimes, alas! it’s criticism.
Such <em>undiscerning</em> criticism!...”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Lord Chancellor began to think very
swiftly of some tremendous lie that would enable
him to escape at once without incivility from
Lady Laxton’s drawing-room. Then he perceived
that Mrs. Rampound Pilby was asking him;
“Is that <em>the</em> Captain Douglas, or his brother,
who’s in love with the actress woman?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Lord Chancellor made no answer. What
he thought was “Great Silly Idiot! How should
<em>I</em> know?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think it must be <em>the</em> one,—the one who had
to leave Portsmouth in disgrace because of the ragging
scandal. He did nothing there, they say, but
organize practical jokes. Some of them were quite
subtle practical jokes. He’s a cousin of our hostess;
that perhaps accounts for his presence....”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Lord Chancellor’s comment betrayed the
drift of his thoughts. “He’d better not try that
sort of thing on here,” he said. “I abominate—clowning.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Drawing-room did not last very long. Even
Lady Laxton could not miss the manifest gloom of
her principal guest, and after the good-nights
and barley water and lemonade on the great
landing Sir Peter led Lord Moggeridge by the
arm—he hated being led by the arm—into the
small but still spacious apartment that was called
the study. The Lord Chancellor was now very
thirsty; he was not used to abstinence of any sort;
but Sir Peter’s way of suggesting a drink roused
such a fury of resentment in him that he refused
tersely and conclusively. There was nobody else
in the study but Captain Douglas, who seemed to
hesitate upon the verge of some familiar address,
and Lord Woodenhouse, who was thirsty, too,
and held a vast tumbler of whisky and soda,
with a tinkle of ice in it, on his knee in a way
annoying to a parched man. The Lord Chancellor
helped himself to a cigar and assumed the
middle of the fireplace with an air of contentment,
but he could feel the self-control running out of
the heels of his boots.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Peter, after a quite unsuccessful invasion
of his own hearthrug—the Lord Chancellor
stood like a rock—secured the big arm-chair,
stuck his feet out towards his distinguished guest
and resumed a talk that he had been holding with
Lord Woodenhouse about firearms. Mergleson
had as usual been too attentive to his master’s
glass, and the fine edge was off Sir Peter’s deference.
“I always have carried firearms,” he said,
“and I always shall. Used properly they are a
great protection. Even in the country how are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>you to know who you’re going to run up against—anywhen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you might shoot and hit something,”
said Douglas.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Properly used, I said—properly used. Whipping
out a revolver and shooting <em>at</em> a man, that’s
not properly used. Almost as bad as pointing
it at him—which is pretty certain to make him
fly straight at you. If he’s got an ounce of
pluck. But <em>I</em> said properly used and I <em>mean</em>
properly used.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Lord Chancellor tried to think about that
article on Infinities, while appearing to listen to
this fool’s talk. He despised revolvers. Armed
with such eyebrows as his it was natural for him
to despise revolvers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, I’ve got some nice little barkers upstairs,”
said Sir Peter. “I’d almost welcome
a burglar, just to try them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you shoot a burglar,” said Lord Woodenhouse
abruptly, with a gust of that ill-temper
that was frequent at Shonts towards bedtime,
“when he’s not attacking you, it’s murder.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Peter held up an offensively pacifying hand.
“I know <em>that</em>,” he said; “you needn’t tell me
<em>that</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He raised his voice a little to increase his
already excessive accentuations. “<em>I</em> said properly
used.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A yawn took the Lord Chancellor unawares
and he caught it dexterously with his hand.
Then he saw Douglas hastily pull at his little
blond moustache to conceal a smile,—grinning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>ape! What was there to smile at? The man
had been smiling all the evening.</p>

<p class='c011'>Up to something?</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now let me <em>tell</em> you,” said Sir Peter, “let me
<em>tell</em> you the proper way to use a revolver. You
whip it out and <em>instantly</em> let fly at the ground.
You should never let anyone see a revolver ever
before they hear it—see? You let fly at the
ground first off, and the concussion stuns them.
It doesn’t stun you. <em>You</em> expect it, <em>they</em> don’t.
See? There you are—five shots left, master of
the situation.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think, Sir Peter, I’ll bid you good-night,”
said the Lord Chancellor, allowing his eye to rest
for one covetous moment on the decanter, and
struggling with the devil of pride.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Peter made a gesture of extreme friendliness
from his chair, expressive of the Lord Chancellor’s
freedom to do whatever he pleased at Shonts.
“I may perhaps tell you a little story that happened
once in Morocco.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My eyes won’t keep open any longer,” said
Captain Douglas suddenly, with a whirl of his
knuckles into his sockets, and stood up.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Woodenhouse stood up too.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You see,” said Sir Peter, standing also but
sticking to his subject and his hearer. “This
was when I was younger than I am now, you
must understand, and I wasn’t married. Just
mooching about a bit, between business and
pleasure. Under such circumstances one goes
into parts of a foreign town where one wouldn’t
go if one was older and wiser....”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Captain Douglas left Sir Peter and Woodenhouse
to it.</p>

<p class='c011'>He emerged on the landing and selected one
of the lighted candlesticks upon the table.
“Lord!” he whispered. He grimaced in soliloquy
and then perceived the Lord Chancellor
regarding him with suspicion and disfavour from
the ascending staircase. He attempted ease.
For the first time since the train incident he
addressed Lord Moggeridge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I gather, my lord,—don’t believe in ghosts?”
he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Sir,” said the Lord Chancellor, “I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They won’t trouble me to-night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They won’t trouble any of us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fine old house anyhow,” said Captain Douglas.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Lord Chancellor disdained to reply. He
went on his way upstairs.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 4</h3>

<p class='c010'>When the Lord Chancellor sat down before
the thoughtful fire in the fine old panelled room
assigned to him he perceived that he was too
disturbed to sleep. This was going to be an infernal
week-end. The worst week-end he had
ever had. Mrs. Rampound Pilby maddened him;
Timbre, who was a Pragmatist—which stands
in the same relation to a Hegelian that a small
dog does to a large cat—exasperated him; he
loathed Laxton, detested Rampound Pilby and
feared—as far as he was capable of fearing anything—Captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Douglas. There was no refuge,
no soul in the house to whom he could turn for
consolation and protection from these others.
Slinker Bond could talk only of the affairs of the
party, and the Lord Chancellor, being Lord Chancellor,
had long since lost any interest in the
affairs of the party; Woodenhouse could talk of
nothing. The women were astonishingly negligible.
There were practically no pretty women.
There ought always to be pretty young women
for a Lord Chancellor, pretty <em>young</em> women who
can at least seem to listen....</p>

<p class='c011'>And he was atrociously thirsty.</p>

<p class='c011'>His room was supplied only with water,—stuff
you use to clean your teeth—and nothing
else....</p>

<p class='c011'>No good thinking about it....</p>

<p class='c011'>He decided that the best thing he could do to
compose himself before turning in would be to
sit down at the writing-table and write a few
sheets of Hegelian—about that Infinity article
in the Hibbert. There is indeed no better consolation
for a troubled mind than the Hegelian
exercises; they lift it above—everything. He
took off his coat and sat down to this beautiful
amusement, but he had scarcely written a page
before his thirst became a torment. He kept
thinking of that great tumbler Woodenhouse had
held,—sparkling, golden, cool—and stimulating.</p>

<p class='c011'>What he wanted was a good stiff whisky and a
cigar, one of Laxton’s cigars, the only good thing
in his entertainment so far.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then Philosophy.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Even as a student he had been a worker of the
Teutonic type,—never abstemious.</p>

<p class='c011'>He thought of ringing and demanding these
comforts, and then it occurred to him that it was
a little late to ring for things. Why not fetch
them from the study himself?...</p>

<p class='c011'>He opened his door and looked out upon the
great staircase. It was a fine piece of work,
that staircase. Low, broad, dignified....</p>

<p class='c011'>There seemed to be nobody about. The
lights were still on. He listened for a little while,
and then put on his coat and went with a soft
swiftness that was still quite dignified downstairs
to the study, the study redolent of Sir
Peter.</p>

<p class='c011'>He made his modest collection.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Moggeridge came nearer to satisfaction
as he emerged from the study that night at Shonts
than at any other moment during this ill-advised
week-end. In his pocket were four thoroughly
good cigars. In one hand he held a cut glass
decanter of whisky. In the other a capacious
tumbler. Under his arm, with that confidence
in the unlimited portative power of his arm that
nothing could shake, he had tucked the syphon.
His soul rested upon the edge of tranquillity
like a bird that has escaped the fowler. He was
already composing his next sentence about that
new variety of Infinity....</p>

<p class='c011'>Then something struck him from behind and
impelled him forward a couple of paces. It was
something hairy, something in the nature, he
thought afterwards, of a worn broom. And also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>there were two other things softer and a little
higher on each side....</p>

<p class='c011'>Then it was he made that noise like the young
of some large animal.</p>

<p class='c011'>He dropped the glass in a hasty attempt to save
the syphon....</p>

<p class='c011'>“What in the name of Heaven—?” he cried,
and found himself alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Captain Douglas!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The thought leapt to his mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>But indeed, it was not Captain Douglas. It
was Bealby. Bealby in panic flight from Thomas.
And how was Bealby to know that this large,
richly laden man was the Lord Chancellor of
England? Never before had Bealby seen anyone
in evening dress except a butler, and so he supposed
this was just some larger, finer kind of
butler that they kept upstairs. Some larger,
finer kind of butler blocking the path of escape.
Bealby had taken in the situation with the rapidity
of a hunted animal. The massive form
blocked the door to the left....</p>

<p class='c011'>In the playground of the village school Bealby
had been preëminent for his dodging; he moved
as quickly as a lizard. His little hands, his head,
poised with the skill of a practised butter, came
against that mighty back, and then Bealby had
dodged into the study....</p>

<p class='c011'>But it seemed to Lord Moggeridge, staggering
over his broken glass and circling about defensively,
that this fearful indignity could come only
from Captain Douglas. Foolery.... Blup,
blup.... Sham Poltergeist. Imbeciles....</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>He said as much, believing that this young man
and possibly confederates were within hearing;
he said as much—hotly. He went on to remark
of an unphilosophical tendency about Captain
Douglas generally, and about army officers, practical
joking, Laxton’s hospitalities, Shonts....
Thomas, you will remember, heard him....</p>

<p class='c011'>Nothing came of it. No answer, not a word of
apology.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last in a great dudgeon and with a kind of
wariness about his back, the Lord Chancellor,
with things more spoilt for him than ever, went
on his way upstairs.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the green baize door opened behind him,
he turned like a shot, and a large foolish-faced
butler appeared. Lord Moggeridge, with a
sceptre-like motion of the decanter, very quietly
and firmly asked him a simple question and then,
then the lunatic must needs leap up three stairs
and dive suddenly and upsettingly at his legs.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Moggeridge was paralyzed with amazement.
His legs were struck from under him. He
uttered one brief topographical cry.</p>

<p class='c011'>(To Sir Peter unfortunately it sounded like
“Help!”)</p>

<p class='c011'>For a few seconds the impressions that rushed
upon Lord Moggeridge were too rapid for adequate
examination. He had a compelling fancy to kill
butlers. Things culminated in a pistol shot.
And then he found himself sitting on the landing
beside a disgracefully dishevelled manservant, and
his host was running downstairs to them with a
revolver in his hand.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>On occasion Lord Moggeridge could produce a
tremendous voice. He did so now. For a moment
he stared panting at Sir Peter, and then
emphasized by a pointing finger came the voice.
Never had it been so charged with emotion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What does this <em>mean</em>, you, Sir?” he shouted.
“What does this mean?”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was exactly what Sir Peter had intended to
say.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 5</h3>

<p class='c010'>Explanations are detestable things.</p>

<p class='c011'>And anyhow it isn’t right to address your host
as “You, Sir.”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 6</h3>

<p class='c010'>Throughout the evening the persuasion had
grown in Lady Laxton’s mind that all was not
going well with the Lord Chancellor. It was
impossible to believe he was enjoying himself.
But she did not know how to give things a turn
for the better. Clever women would have known,
but she was so convinced she was not clever that
she did not even try.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thing after thing had gone wrong.</p>

<p class='c011'>How was she to know that there were two
sorts of philosophy,—quite different? She had
thought philosophy was philosophy. But it
seemed that there were these two sorts, if not
more; a round large sort that talked about the
Absolute and was scornfully superior and rather
irascible, and a jabby-pointed sort that called
people “Tender” or “Tough,” and was generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>much too familiar. To bring them together was
just mixing trouble. There ought to be little
books for hostesses explaining these things....</p>

<p class='c011'>Then it was extraordinary that the Lord Chancellor,
who was so tremendously large and clever,
wouldn’t go and talk to Mrs. Rampound Pilby,
who was also so tremendously large and clever.
Repeatedly Lady Laxton had tried to get them
into touch with one another. Until at last the
Lord Chancellor had said distinctly and deliberately,
when she had suggested his going across to
the eminent writer, “God forbid!” Her dream
of a large clever duologue that she could afterwards
recall with pleasure was altogether shattered.
She thought the Lord Chancellor uncommonly
hard to please. These weren’t the only
people for him. Why couldn’t he chat party
secrets with Slinker Bond or say things to Lord
Woodenhouse? You could say anything you
liked to Lord Woodenhouse. Or talk with Mr.
Timbre. Mrs. Timbre had given him an excellent
opening; she had asked, “Wasn’t it a dreadful
anxiety always to have the Great Seal to mind?”
He had simply <em>grunted</em>.... And then why did
he keep on looking so <em>dangerously</em> at Captain
Douglas?...</p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps to-morrow things would take a turn
for the better....</p>

<p class='c011'>One can at least be hopeful. Even if one is not
<em>clever</em> one can be that....</p>

<p class='c011'>From such thoughts as these it was that this
unhappy hostess was roused by a sound of smashing
glass, a rumpus, and a pistol shot.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>She stood up, she laid her hand on her heart,
she said “<em>Oh!</em>” and gripped her dressing-table
for support....</p>

<p class='c011'>After a long time and when it seemed that it
was now nothing more than a hubbub of voices,
in which her husband’s could be distinguished
clearly, she crept out very softly upon the upper
landing.</p>

<p class='c011'>She perceived her cousin, Captain Douglas,
looking extremely fair and frail and untrustworthy
in a much too gorgeous kimono dressing-gown of
embroidered Japanese silk. “I can assure you,
my lord,” he was saying in a strange high-pitched
deliberate voice, “on—my—word—of—honour—as—a—soldier,
that I know absolutely nothing
about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure it wasn’t all imagination, my lord?” Sir
Peter asked with his inevitable infelicity....</p>

<p class='c011'>She decided to lean over the balustrading and
ask very quietly and clearly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lord Moggeridge, please! is anything the
matter?”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 6</h3>

<p class='c010'>All human beings are egotists, but there is no
egotism to compare with the egotism of the very
young.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby was so much the centre of his world
that he was incapable of any interpretation of
this shouting and uproar, this smashing of decanters
and firing of pistol shots, except in reference
to himself. He supposed it to be a Hue and
Cry. He supposed that he was being hunted—hunted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>by a pack of great butlers hounded on by
the irreparably injured Thomas. The thought
of upstairs gentlefolks passed quite out of his
mind. He snatched up a faked Syrian dagger
that lay, in the capacity of a paper knife, on the
study table, concealed himself under the chintz
valance of a sofa, adjusted its rumpled skirts
neatly, and awaited the issue of events.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a time events did not issue. They remained
talking noisily upon the great staircase.
Bealby could not hear what was said, but most of
what was said appeared to be flat contradiction.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perchance,” whispered Bealby to himself,
gathering courage, “perchance we have eluded
them.... A breathing space....”</p>

<p class='c011'>At last a woman’s voice mingled with the
others and seemed a little to assuage them....</p>

<p class='c011'>Then it seemed to Bealby that they were dispersing
to beat the house for him. “Good-night
<em>again</em> then,” said someone.</p>

<p class='c011'>That puzzled him, but he decided it was a
“blind.” He remained very, very still.</p>

<p class='c011'>He heard a clicking in the apartment—the
blue parlour it was called—between the study
and the dining-room. Electric light?</p>

<p class='c011'>Then some one came into the study. Bealby’s
eye was as close to the ground as he could get it.
He was breathless, he moved his head with an
immense circumspection. The valance was translucent
but not transparent, below it there was a
crack of vision, a strip of carpet, the castors of
chairs. Among these things he perceived feet—not
ankles, it did not go up to that, but just feet.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Large flattish feet. A pair. They stood still,
and Bealby’s hand lighted on the hilt of his
dagger.</p>

<p class='c011'>The person above the feet seemed to be surveying
the room or reflecting.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drunk!... Old fool’s either drunk or mad!
That’s about the truth of it,” said a voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mergleson! Angry, but parroty and unmistakable.</p>

<p class='c011'>The feet went across to the table and there
were faint sounds of refreshment, discreetly
administered. Then a moment of profound stillness....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” said the voice at last, a voice renewed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the feet went to the passage door, halted
in the doorway. There was a double click. The
lights went out. Bealby was in absolute darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then a distant door closed and silence followed
upon the dark....</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Mergleson descended to a pantry ablaze
with curiosity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Lord Chancellor’s going dotty,” said
Mr. Mergleson, replying to the inevitable question.
“<em>That’s</em> what’s up.” ...</p>

<p class='c011'>“I tried to save the blessed syphon,” said Mr.
Mergleson, pursuing his narrative, “and ’e sprang
on me like a leppard. I suppose ’e thought I
wanted to take it away from ’im. ’E’d broke a
glass already. ’<em>Ow</em>,—I <em>don’t</em> know. There it
was, lying on the landing....”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Ere’s where ’e bit my ’and,” said Mr. Mergleson....</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>A curious little side-issue occurred to Thomas.
“Where’s young Kicker all this time?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lord!” said Mr. Mergleson, “all them other
things; they clean drove ’im out of my ’ed. I
suppose ’e’s up there, hiding somewhere....”</p>

<p class='c011'>He paused. His eye consulted the eye of
Thomas.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’E’s got behind a curtain or something,” said
Mr. Mergleson....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Queer where ’e can ’ave got to,” said Mr.
Mergleson....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can’t be bothered about ’im,” said Mr.
Mergleson.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I expect he’ll sneak down to ’is room when
things are quiet,” said Thomas, after reflection.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No good going and looking for ’im now,”
said Mr. Mergleson. “Things upstairs,—they
<em>got</em> to settle down....”</p>

<p class='c011'>But in the small hours Mr. Mergleson awakened
and thought of Bealby and wondered whether he
was in bed. This became so great an uneasiness
that about the hour of dawn he got up and went
along the passage to Bealby’s compartment.
Bealby was not there and his bed had not been
slept in.</p>

<p class='c011'>That sinister sense of gathering misfortunes
which comes to all of us at times in the small
hours, was so strong in the mind of Mr. Mergleson
that he went on and told Thomas of this
disconcerting fact. Thomas woke with difficulty
and rather crossly, but sat up at last, alive to
the gravity of Mr. Mergleson’s mood.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“If ’e’s found hiding about upstairs after all
this upset,” said Mr. Mergleson, and left the
rest of the sentence to a sympathetic imagination.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now it’s light,” said Mr. Mergleson after a
slight pause, “I think we better just go round
and ’ave a look for ’im. Both of us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Thomas clad himself provisionally, and
the two man-servants went upstairs very softly
and began a series of furtive sweeping movements—very
much in the spirit of Lord Kitchener’s
historical sweeping movements in the
Transvaal—through the stately old rooms in
which Bealby must be lurking....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 8</h3>

<p class='c010'>Man is the most restless of animals. There is
an incessant urgency in his nature. He never
knows when he is well off. And so it was that
Bealby’s comparative security under the sofa
became presently too irksome to be endured.
He seemed to himself to stay there for ages,
but as a matter of fact, he stayed there only
twenty minutes. Then with eyes tempered to
the darkness he first struck out an alert attentive
head, then crept out and remained for the space
of half a minute on all fours surveying the indistinct
blacknesses about him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he knelt up. Then he stood up. Then
with arms extended and cautious steps he began
an exploration of the apartment.</p>

<p class='c011'>The passion for exploration grows with what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>it feeds upon. Presently Bealby was feeling
his way into the blue parlour and then round by
its shuttered and curtained windows to the dining-room.
His head was now full of the idea of some
shelter, more permanent, less pervious to housemaids,
than that sofa. He knew enough now of
domestic routines to know that upstairs in the
early morning was much routed by housemaids.
He found many perplexing turns and corners,
and finally got into the dining-room fireplace
where it was very dark and kicked against some
fire-irons. That made his heart beat fast for a
time. Then groping on past it, he found in the
darkness what few people could have found in
the day, the stud that released the panel that
hid the opening of the way that led to the
priest hole. He felt the thing open, and halted
perplexed. In that corner there wasn’t a ray
of light. For a long time he was trying to think
what this opening could be, and then he concluded
it was some sort of back way from downstairs....
Well, anyhow it was all exploring.
With an extreme gingerliness he got himself
through the panel. He closed it almost completely
behind him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Careful investigation brought him to the view
that he was in a narrow passage of brick or stone
that came in a score of paces to a spiral staircase
going both up and down. Up this he went, and
presently breathed cool night air and had a
glimpse of stars through a narrow slit-like window
almost blocked by ivy. Then—what was very
disagreeable—something scampered.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>When Bealby’s heart recovered he went on
up again.</p>

<p class='c011'>He came to the priest hole, a capacious cell
six feet square with a bench bed and a little
table and chair. It had a small door upon the
stairs that was open and a niche cupboard. Here
he remained for a time. Then restlessness made
him explore a cramped passage, he had to crawl
along it for some yards, that came presently into
a curious space with wood on one side and stone
on the other. Then ahead, most blessed thing!
he saw light.</p>

<p class='c011'>He went blundering toward it and then stopped
appalled. From the other side of this wooden
wall to the right of him had come a voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come in!” said the voice. A rich masculine
voice that seemed scarcely two yards away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby became rigid. Then after a long interval
he moved—as softly as he could.</p>

<p class='c011'>The voice soliloquized.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby listened intently, and then when all
was still again crept forward two paces more
towards the gleam. It was a peephole.</p>

<p class='c011'>The unseen speaker was walking about. Bealby
listened, and the sound of his beating heart
mingled with the pad, pad, of slippered footsteps.
Then with a brilliant effort his eye was
at the chink. All was still again. For a time
he was perplexed by what he saw, a large pink
shining dome, against a deep greenish grey background.
At the base of the dome was a kind of
interrupted hedge, brown and leafless....</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he realized that he was looking at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>top of a head and two enormous eyebrows. The
rest was hidden....</p>

<p class='c011'>Nature surprised Bealby into a penetrating
sniff.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now,” said the occupant of the room, and
suddenly he was standing up—Bealby saw a
long hairy neck sticking out of a dressing-gown—and
walking to the side of the room. “I won’t
stand it,” said the great voice, “I won’t stand
it. Ape’s foolery!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the Lord Chancellor began rapping at
the panelling about his apartment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hollow! It all sounds hollow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Only after a long interval did he resume his
writing....</p>

<p class='c011'>All night long that rat behind the wainscot
troubled the Lord Chancellor. Whenever he spoke,
whenever he moved about, it was still; whenever
he composed himself to write it began to rustle
and blunder. Again and again it sniffed,—an
annoying kind of sniff. At last the Lord Chancellor
gave up his philosophical relaxation and
went to bed, turned out the lights and attempted
sleep, but this only intensified his sense of an uneasy,
sniffing presence close to him. When the
light was out it seemed to him that this Thing,
whatever it was, instantly came into the room
and set the floor creaking and snapping. A
Thing perpetually attempting something and
perpetually thwarted....</p>

<p class='c011'>The Lord Chancellor did not sleep a wink.
The first feeble infiltration of day found him sitting
up in bed, wearily wrathful.... And now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>surely someone was going along the passage
outside!</p>

<p class='c011'>A great desire to hurt somebody very much
seized upon the Lord Chancellor. Perhaps he
might hurt that dismal <em>farceur</em> upon the landing!
No doubt it was Douglas sneaking back to his
own room after the night’s efforts.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Lord Chancellor slipped on his dressing-gown
of purple silk. Very softly indeed did he
open his bedroom door and very warily peep out.
He heard the soft pad of feet upon the staircase.</p>

<p class='c011'>He crept across the broad passage to the beautiful
old balustrading. Down below he saw
Mergleson—Mergleson again!—in a shameful
deshabille—going like a snake, like a slinking
cat, like an assassin, into the door of the study.
Rage filled the great man’s soul. Gathering up
the skirts of his dressing-gown he started in a
swift yet noiseless pursuit.</p>

<p class='c011'>He followed Mergleson through the little parlour
and into the dining-room, and then he saw
it all! There was a panel open, and Mergleson
very cautiously going in. Of course! They had
got at him through the priest hole. They had
been playing on his nerves. All night they had
been doing it—no doubt in relays. The whole
house was in this conspiracy.</p>

<p class='c011'>With his eyebrows spread like the wings of
a fighting cock the Lord Chancellor in five vast
noiseless strides had crossed the intervening
space and gripped the butler by his collarless
shirt as he was disappearing. It was like a hawk
striking a sparrow. Mergleson felt himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>clutched, glanced over his shoulder and, seeing
that fierce familiar face again close to his own,
pitiless, vindictive, lost all sense of human dignity
and yelled like a lost soul....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 9</h3>

<p class='c010'>Sir Peter Laxton was awakened from an uneasy
sleep by the opening of the dressing-room door
that connected his room with his wife’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>He sat up astonished and stared at her white
face, its pallor exaggerated by the cold light of
dawn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Peter,” she said, “I’m sure there’s something
more going on.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Something more going on?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Something—shouting and swearing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You don’t mean—?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She nodded. “The Lord Chancellor,” she said,
in an awe-stricken whisper. “He’s at it again.
Downstairs in the dining-room.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Peter seemed disposed at first to receive this
quite passively. Then he flashed into extravagant
wrath. “I’m <em>damned</em>,” he cried, jumping
violently out of bed, “if I’m going to stand this!
Not if he was a hundred Lord Chancellors!
He’s turning the place into a bally lunatic asylum.
<em>Once</em>—one might excuse. But to start in again....
<em>What’s that?</em>”</p>

<p class='c011'>They both stood still listening. Faintly yet
quite distinctly came the agonized cry of some
imperfectly educated person,—“’Elp!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here! Where’s my trousers?” cried Sir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Peter. “He’s murdering Mergleson. There isn’t
a moment to lose.”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 10</h3>

<p class='c010'>Until Sir Peter returned Lady Laxton sat quite
still just as he had left her on his bed, aghast.</p>

<p class='c011'>She could not even pray.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sun had still to rise; the room was full of
that cold weak inky light, light without warmth,
knowledge without faith, existence without courage,
that creeps in before the day. She waited....
In such a mood women have waited for
massacre....</p>

<p class='c011'>Downstairs a raucous shouting....</p>

<p class='c011'>She thought of her happy childhood upon the
Yorkshire wolds, before the idea of week-end
parties had entered her mind. The heather.
The little birds. Kind things. A tear ran down
her cheek....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 11</h3>

<p class='c010'>Then Sir Peter stood before her again, alive
still, but breathless and greatly ruffled.</p>

<p class='c011'>She put her hands to her heart. She would be
brave.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” she said. “Tell me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’s as mad as a hatter,” said Sir Peter.</p>

<p class='c011'>She nodded for more. She knew that.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Has he—<em>killed</em> anyone?” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He looked uncommonly like trying,” said Sir
Peter.</p>

<p class='c011'>She nodded, her lips tightly compressed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“Says Douglas will either have to leave the
house or he does.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—Douglas!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know, but he won’t hear a word.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But <em>why</em> Douglas?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I tell you he’s as mad as a hatter. Got persecution
mania. People tapping and bells ringing
under his pillow all night—that sort of idea....
And furious. I tell you,—he frightened me.
He was <em>awful</em>. He’s given Mergleson a black
eye. Hit him, you know. With his fist. Caught
him in the passage to the priest hole—how they
got there <em>I</em> don’t know—and went for him like
a madman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what has Douglas done?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know. I asked him, but he won’t listen.
He’s just off his head.... Says Douglas has
got the whole household trying to work a ghost
on him. I tell you—he’s off his nut.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Husband and wife looked at each other....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course if Douglas didn’t mind just going off
to oblige me,” said Sir Peter at last....</p>

<p class='c011'>“It might calm him,” he explained....
“You see, it’s all so infernally awkward....”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is he back in his room?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. Waiting for me to decide about Douglas.
Walking up and down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a little while their minds remained prostrate
and inactive.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d been so looking forward to the lunch,”
she said with a joyless smile. “The county—”</p>

<p class='c011'>She could not go on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know,” said Sir Peter, “one thing,—I’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>see to it myself. I won’t have him have a
single drop of liquor more. If we have to search
his room.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What I shall say to him at breakfast,” she
said, “I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Peter reflected. “There’s no earthly reason
why you should be brought into it at all. Your
line is to know nothing about it. <em>Show</em> him
you know nothing about it. Ask him—ask him
if he’s had a good night....”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>THE WANDERERS</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 1</h3>

<p class='c010'>Never had the gracious eastward face of
Shonts looked more beautiful than it did on the
morning of the Lord Chancellor’s visit. It
glowed as translucent as amber lit by flames,
its two towers were pillars of pale gold. It looked
over its slopes and parapets upon a great valley
of mist-barred freshness through which the distant
river shone like a snake of light. The south-west
façade was still in the shadow, and the ivy hung
from it darkly greener than the greenest green.
The stained-glass windows of the old chapel
reflected the sunrise as though lamps were burning
inside. Along the terrace a pensive peacock
trailed his sheathed splendours through the dew.</p>

<p class='c011'>Amidst the ivy was a fuss of birds.</p>

<p class='c011'>And presently there was pushed out from amidst
the ivy at the foot of the eastward tower a little
brownish buff thing, that seemed as natural there
as a squirrel or a rabbit. It was a head,—a
ruffled human head. It remained still for a
moment contemplating the calm spaciousness of
terrace and garden and countryside. Then it
emerged further and rotated and surveyed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>house above it. Its expression was one of alert
caution. Its natural freshness and innocence
were a little marred by an enormous transverse
smudge, a bar-sinister of smut, and the elfin
delicacy of the left ear was festooned with a cobweb—probably
a genuine antique. It was the
face of Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was considering the advisability of leaving
Shonts—for good.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently his decision was made. His hands
and shoulders appeared following his head, and
then a dusty but undamaged Bealby was running
swiftly towards the corner of the shrubbery.
He crouched lest at any moment that pursuing
pack of butlers should see him and give tongue.
In another moment he was hidden from the house
altogether, and rustling his way through a thicket
of budding rhododendra. After those dirty passages
the morning air was wonderfully sweet—but
just a trifle hungry.</p>

<p class='c011'>Grazing deer saw Bealby fly across the park,
stared at him for a time with great gentle unintelligent
eyes, and went on feeding.</p>

<p class='c011'>They saw him stop ever and again. He was
snatching at mushrooms, that he devoured forthwith
as he sped on.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the edge of the beech-woods he paused and
glanced back at Shonts.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then his eyes rested for a moment on the clump
of trees through which one saw a scrap of the head
gardener’s cottage, a bit of the garden wall....</p>

<p class='c011'>A physiognomist might have detected a certain
lack of self-confidence in Bealby’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>But his spirit was not to be quelled. Slowly,
joylessly perhaps, but with a grave determination,
he raised his hand in that prehistoric gesture
of the hand and face by which youth, since ever
there was youth, has asserted the integrity of its
soul against established and predominant things.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Ketch</em> me!” said Bealby.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 2</h3>

<p class='c010'>Bealby left Shonts about half-past four in the
morning. He went westward because he liked
the company of his shadow and was amused at
first by its vast length. By half-past eight he
had covered ten miles, and he was rather bored
by his shadow. He had eaten nine raw mushrooms,
two green apples and a quantity of unripe
blackberries. None of these things seemed quite
at home in him. And he had discovered himself
to be wearing slippers. They were stout carpet
slippers, but still they were slippers,—and the
road was telling on them. At the ninth mile the
left one began to give on the outer seam. He got
over a stile into a path that ran through the corner
of a wood, and there he met a smell of frying
bacon that turned his very soul to gastric juice.</p>

<p class='c011'>He stopped short and sniffed the air—and the
air itself was sizzling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Krikey,” said Bealby, manifestly to the
Spirit of the World. “This is a bit too strong.
I wasn’t thinking much before.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he saw something bright yellow and bulky
just over the hedge.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>From this it was that the sound of frying came.</p>

<p class='c011'>He went to the hedge, making no effort to conceal
himself. Outside a great yellow caravan with
dainty little windows stood a largish dark woman
in a deerstalker hat, a short brown skirt, a large
white apron and spatterdashes (among other
things), frying bacon and potatoes in a frying pan.
She was very red in the face, and the frying pan
was spitting at her as frying pans do at a timid
cook....</p>

<p class='c011'>Quite mechanically Bealby scrambled through
the hedge and drew nearer this divine smell.
The woman scrutinized him for a moment, and
then blinking and averting her face went on with
her cookery.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby came quite close to her and remained,
noting the bits of potato that swam about in the
pan, the jolly curling of the rashers, the dancing
of the bubbles, the hymning splash and splutter
of the happy fat....</p>

<p class='c011'>(If it should ever fall to my lot to be cooked,
may I be fried in potatoes and butter. May I
be fried with potatoes and good butter made from
the milk of the cow. God send I am spared
boiling; the prison of the pot, the rattling lid,
the evil darkness, the greasy water....)</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose,” said the lady prodding with her
fork at the bacon, “I suppose you call yourself a
Boy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, miss,” said Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you ever fried?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I could, miss.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Like this?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“Better”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just lay hold of this handle—for it’s scorching
the skin off my face I am.” She seemed to
think for a moment and added, “entirely.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In silence Bealby grasped that exquisite smell
by the handle, he took the fork from her hand
and put his hungry eager nose over the seething
mess. It wasn’t only bacon; there were onions,
onions giving it—an <em>edge</em>! It cut to the quick
of appetite. He could have wept with the intensity
of his sensations.</p>

<p class='c011'>A voice almost as delicious as the smell came
out of the caravan window behind Bealby’s head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Ju</em>-dy!” cried the voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here!—I mean,—it’s here I am,” said the
lady in the deerstalker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Judy—you didn’t take my stockings for your
own by any chance?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady in the deerstalker gave way to delighted
horror. “Sssh, Mavourneen!” she cried—she
was one of that large class of amiable
women who are more Irish than they need be—“there’s
a Boy here!”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 3</h3>

<p class='c010'>There was indeed an almost obsequiously industrious
and obliging Boy. An hour later he was
no longer a Boy but <em>the</em> Boy, and three friendly
women were regarding him with a merited approval.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had done the frying, renewed a waning fire
with remarkable skill and dispatch, reboiled a
neglected kettle in the shortest possible time, laid
almost without direction a simple meal, very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>exactly set out campstools and cleaned the frying
pan marvellously. Hardly had they taken their
portions of that appetizing savouriness, than he
had whipped off with that implement, gone behind
the caravan, busied himself there, and returned
with the pan—glittering bright. Himself if
possible brighter. One cheek indeed shone with
an animated glow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But wasn’t there some of the bacon and stuff
left?” asked the lady in the deerstalker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I didn’t think it was wanted, Miss,” said
Bealby. “So I cleared it up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He met understanding in her eye. He questioned
her expression.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mayn’t I wash up for you, miss?” he asked to
relieve the tension.</p>

<p class='c011'>He washed up, swiftly and cleanly. He had
never been able to wash up to Mr. Mergleson’s
satisfaction before, but now he did everything
Mr. Mergleson had ever told him. He asked
where to put the things away and he put them
away. Then he asked politely if there was anything
else he could do for them. Questioned,
he said he liked doing things. “You haven’t,”
said the lady in the deerstalker, “a taste for
cleaning boots?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby declared he had.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Surely,” said a voice that Bealby adored,
“’tis an angel from heaven.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had a taste for cleaning boots! This was
an extraordinary thing for Bealby to say. But a
great change had come to him in the last half-hour.
He was violently anxious to do things,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>any sort of things, servile things, for a particular
person. He was in love.</p>

<p class='c011'>The owner of the beautiful voice had come out of
the caravan, she had stood for a moment in the
doorway before descending the steps to the ground
and the soul of Bealby had bowed down before
her in instant submission. Never had he seen
anything so lovely. Her straight slender body
was sheathed in blue; fair hair, a little tinged with
red, poured gloriously back from her broad forehead,
and she had the sweetest eyes in the world.
One hand lifted her dress from her feet; the other
rested on the lintel of the caravan door. She
looked at him and smiled.</p>

<p class='c011'>So for two years she had looked and smiled
across the footlights to the Bealby in mankind.
She had smiled now on her entrance out of habit.
She took the effect upon Bealby as a foregone
conclusion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she had looked to make sure that everything
was ready before she descended.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How good it smells, Judy!” she had said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve had a helper,” said the woman who wore
spats.</p>

<p class='c011'>That time the blue-eyed lady had smiled at him
quite definitely....</p>

<p class='c011'>The third member of the party had appeared
unobserved; the irradiations of the beautiful lady
had obscured her. Bealby discovered her about.
She was bareheaded; she wore a simple grey
dress with a Norfolk jacket, and she had a pretty
clear white profile under black hair. She answered
to the name of “Winnie.” The beautiful lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>was Madeleine. They made little obscure jokes
with each other and praised the morning ardently.
“This is the best place of all,” said Madeleine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All night,” said Winnie, “not a single mosquito.”</p>

<p class='c011'>None of these three ladies made any attempt to
conceal the sincerity of their hunger or their
appreciation of Bealby’s assistance. How good a
thing is appreciation! Here he was doing, with
joy and pride and an eager excellence, the very
services he had done so badly under the cuffings
of Mergleson and Thomas....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 4</h3>

<p class='c010'>And now Bealby, having been regarded with
approval for some moments and discussed in
tantalizing undertones, was called upon to explain
himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Boy,” said the lady in the deerstalker, who
was evidently the leader and still more evidently
the spokeswoman of the party, “come here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, miss.” He put down the boot he was
cleaning on the caravan step.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the first place, know by these presents,
I am a married woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, miss.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And miss is not a seemly mode of address
for me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, miss. I mean—” Bealby hung for a
moment and by the happiest of accidents, a scrap
of his instruction at Shonts came up in his mind.
“No,” he said, “your—ladyship.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>A great light shone on the spokeswoman’s face.
“Not yet, my child,” she said, “not yet. He hasn’t
done his duty by me. I am—a simple Mum.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby was intelligently silent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say—Yes, Mum.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Mum,” said Bealby and everybody
laughed very agreeably.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now,” said the lady, taking pleasure in her
words, “know by these presents—By the bye,
what is your name?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby scarcely hesitated. “Dick Mal-travers,
Mum,” he said and almost added, “The Dauntless
Daredevil of the Diamond-fields Horse,” which
was the second title.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dick will do,” said the lady who was called
Judy, and added suddenly and very amusingly:
“You may keep the rest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>(These were the sort of people Bealby liked.
The <em>right</em> sort.)</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Dick, we want to know, have you ever
been in service?”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was sudden. But Bealby was equal to it.
“Only for a day or two, miss—I mean, Mum,—just
to be useful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Were</em> you useful?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby tried to think whether he had been,
and could recall nothing but the face of Thomas
with the fork hanging from it. “I did my best,
Mum,” he said impartially.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And all that is over?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Mum.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you’re at home again and out of employment?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“Yes, Mum.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you live near here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No—leastways, not very far.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“With your father.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stepfather, Mum. I’m a Norfan.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, how would you like to come with us
for a few days and help with things? Seven-and-sixpence
a week.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby’s face was eloquent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would your stepfather object?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby considered. “I don’t think he would,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’d better go round and ask him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—suppose—yes,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And get a few things.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Things, Mum?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Collars and things. You needn’t bring a
great box for such a little while.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Mum....”</p>

<p class='c011'>He hovered rather undecidedly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Better run along now. Our man and horse
will be coming presently. We shan’t be able to
wait for you long....”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby assumed a sudden briskness and departed.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the gate of the field he hesitated almost
imperceptibly and then directed his face to the
Sabbath stillness of the village.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perplexity corrugated his features. The stepfather’s
permission presented no difficulties, but
it was more difficult about the luggage.</p>

<p class='c011'>A voice called after him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Mum?” he said attentive and hopeful.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Perhaps—somehow—they wouldn’t want luggage.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ll want Boots. You’ll have to walk by
the caravan, you know. You’ll want some good
stout Boots.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, Mum,” he said with a sorrowful
break in his voice. He waited a few moments
but nothing more came. He went on—very
slowly. He had forgotten about the boots.</p>

<p class='c011'>That defeated him....</p>

<p class='c011'>It is hard to be refused admission to Paradise
for the want of a hand-bag and a pair of walking-boots....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 5</h3>

<p class='c010'>Bealby was by no means certain that he was
going back to that caravan. He wanted to do
so quite painfully, but—</p>

<p class='c011'>He’d just look a fool going back without boots
and—nothing on earth would reconcile him to
the idea of looking a fool in the eyes of that beautiful
woman in blue.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dick,” he whispered to himself despondently,
“Daredevil Dick!” (A more miserable-looking
face you never set eyes on.) “It’s all up with your
little schemes, Dick, my boy. You <em>must</em> get a
bag—and nothing on earth will get you a bag.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He paid little heed to the village through which
he wandered. He knew there were no bags
there. Chance rather than any volition of his
own guided him down a side path that led to the
nearly dry bed of a little rivulet, and there he sat
down on some weedy grass under a group of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>willows. It was an untidy place that needed all
the sunshine of the morning to be tolerable;
one of those places where stinging nettles take
heart and people throw old kettles, broken gallipots,
jaded gravel, grass cuttings, rusty rubbish,
old boots—.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a time Bealby’s eyes rested on the objects
with an entire lack of interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he was reminded of his not so very remote
childhood when he had found an old boot and made
it into a castle....</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently he got up and walked across to the
rubbish heap and surveyed its treasures with a
quickened intelligence. He picked up a widowed
boot and weighed it in his hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>He dropped it abruptly, turned about and
hurried back into the village street.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had ideas, two ideas, one for the luggage
and one for the boots.... If only he could
manage it. Hope beat his great pinions in the
heart of Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sunday! The shops were shut. Yes, that was
a fresh obstacle. He’d forgotten that.</p>

<p class='c011'>The public-house stood bashfully open, the shy
uninviting openness of Sunday morning before
closing time, but public-houses, alas! at all hours
are forbidden to little boys. And besides he
wasn’t likely to get what he wanted in a public-house;
he wanted a shop, a general shop. And
here before him was the general shop—and its
door ajar! His desire carried him over the threshold.
The Sabbatical shutters made the place
dark and cool, and the smell of bacon and cheese
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>and chandleries, the very spirit of grocery, calm
and unhurried, was cool and Sabbatical, too, as if
it sat there for the day in its best clothes. And
a pleasant woman was talking over the counter
to a thin and worried one who carried a bundle.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their intercourse had a flavour of emergency,
and they both stopped abruptly at the appearance
of Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>His desire, his craving was now so great that it
had altogether subdued the natural wiriness of
his appearance. He looked meek, he looked
good, he was swimming in propitiation and tender
with respect. He produced an effect of being
much smaller. He had got nice eyes. His
movements were refined and his manners perfect.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not doing business to-day, my boy,” said
the pleasant woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, <em>please</em> ’m,” he said from his heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sunday, you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, <em>please</em> ’m. If you could just give me a
nold sheet of paper ’m, please.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What for?” asked the pleasant woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just to wrap something up ’m.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She reflected, and natural goodness had its way
with her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A nice <em>big</em> bit?” said the woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please ’m.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would you like it brown?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, <em>please</em> ’m.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you got some string??</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only cottony stuff,” said Bealby, disembowelling
a trouser pocket. “Wiv knots. But I
dessay I can manage.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“You’d better have a bit of good string with
it, my dear,” said the pleasant woman, whose
generosity was now fairly on the run, “Then
you can do your parcel up nice and tidy....”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 6</h3>

<p class='c010'>The white horse was already in the shafts of
the caravan, and William, a deaf and clumsy man
of uncertain age and a vast sharp nosiness, was
lifting in the basket of breakfast gear and grumbling
in undertones at the wickedness and unfairness
of travelling on Sunday, when Bealby returned
to gladden three waiting women.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” said the inconspicuous lady, “I knew
he’d come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look at his poor little precious parsivel,”
said the actress.</p>

<p class='c011'>Regarded as luggage it was rather pitiful; a
knobby, brown paper parcel about the size—to
be perfectly frank—of a tin can, two old boots
and some grass, very carefully folded and tied
up,—and carried gingerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—” the lady in the deerstalker began,
and then paused.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dick,” she said, as he came nearer, “where’s
your boots?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh please, Mum,” said the dauntless one,
“they was away being mended. My stepfather
thought perhaps you wouldn’t mind if I didn’t
have boots. He said perhaps I might be able to
get some more boots out of my salary....”</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady in the deerstalker looked alarmingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>uncertain and Bealby controlled infinite distresses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Haven’t you got a mother, Dick?” asked the
beautiful voice suddenly. Its owner abounded
in such spasmodic curiosities.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She—last year....” Matricide is a painful
business at any time. And just as you see,
in spite of every effort you have made, the jolliest
lark in the world slipping out of your reach.
And the sweet voice so sorry for him! So sorry!
Bealby suddenly veiled his face with his elbow
and gave way to honourable tears....</p>

<p class='c011'>A simultaneous desire to make him happy, help
him to forget his loss, possessed three women....</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’ll be all right, Dick,” said the lady in
the deerstalker, patting his shoulder. “We’ll get
you some boots to-morrow. And to-day you must
sit up beside William and spare your feet. You’ll
have to go to the inns with him....”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s wonderful, the elasticity of youth,”
said the inconspicuous lady five minutes later.
“To see that boy now, you’d never imagine he’d
had a sorrow in the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now get up there,” said the lady who was the
leader. “We shall walk across the fields and
join you later. You understand where you
are to wait for us, William?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She came nearer and shouted, “You understand,
William?”</p>

<p class='c011'>William nodded ambiguously. “’Ent a <em>Vool</em>,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ladies departed. “<em>You’ll</em> be all right,
Dick,” cried the actress kindly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>He sat up where he had been put, trying to
look as Orphan Dick as possible after all that had
occurred.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 7</h3>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know the wind on the heath—have
you lived the Gypsy life? Have you spoken,
wanderers yourselves, with ‘Romany chi and
Romany chal’ on the wind-swept moors at home
or abroad? Have you tramped the broad highways,
and, at close of day, pitched your tent
near a running stream and cooked your supper
by starlight over a fire of pinewood? Do you
know the dreamless sleep of the wanderer at
peace with himself and all the world?”</p>

<p class='c011'>For most of us the answer to these questions
of the Amateur Camping Club is in the negative.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet every year the call of the road, the Borrovian
glamour, draws away a certain small number
of the imaginative from the grosser comforts
of a complex civilization, takes them out into
tents and caravans and intimate communion
with nature, and, incidentally, with various ingenious
appliances designed to meet the needs of
cooking in a breeze. It is an adventure to which
high spirits and great expectations must be
brought, it is an experience in proximity which
few friendships survive—and altogether very
great fun.</p>

<p class='c011'>The life of breezy freedom resolves itself in
practice chiefly into washing up and an anxious
search for permission to camp. One learns how
rich and fruitful our world can be in bystanders,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>and how easy it is to forget essential groceries....</p>

<p class='c011'>The heart of the joy of it lies in its perfect detachment.
There you are in the morning sunlight
under the trees that overhang the road, going
whither you will. Everything you need you
have. Your van creaks along at your side. You
are outside inns, outside houses, a home, a community,
an <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">imperium in imperio</span></i>. At any moment
you may draw out of the traffic upon the wayside
grass and say, “Here—until the owner catches
us at it—is home!” At any time—subject to
the complaisance of William and your being able
to find him—you may inspan and go onward.
The world is all before you. You taste the complete
yet leisurely insouciance of the snail.</p>

<p class='c011'>And two of those three ladies had other satisfactions
to supplement their pleasures. They
both adored Madeleine Philips. She was not
only perfectly sweet and lovely, but she was
known to be so; she had that most potent charm
for women, prestige. They had got her all to
themselves. They could show now how false is
the old idea that there is no friendship nor conversation
among women. They were full of wit
and pretty things for one another and snatches
of song in between. And they were free too from
their “menfolk.” They were doing without them.
Dr. Bowles, the husband of the lady in the deerstalker,
was away in Ireland, and Mr. Geedge,
the lord of the inconspicuous woman, was golfing
at Sandwich. And Madeleine Philips, it was
understood, was only too glad to shake herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>free from the crowd of admirers that hovered
about her like wasps about honey....</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet after three days each one had thoughts
about the need of helpfulness and more particularly
about washing-up, that were better left
unspoken, that were indeed conspicuously unspoken
beneath their merry give and take, like
a black and silent river flowing beneath a bridge
of ivory. And each of them had a curious feeling
in the midst of all this fresh free behaviour, as
though the others were not listening sufficiently,
as though something of the effect of them was
being wasted. Madeleine’s smiles became rarer;
at times she was almost impassive, and Judy
preserved nearly all her wit and verbal fireworks
for the times when they passed through villages....
Mrs. Geedge was less visibly affected. She
had thoughts of writing a book about it all, telling
in the gayest, most provocative way, full of the
quietest quaintest humour, just how jolly they
had been. Menfolk would read it. This kept a
little thin smile upon her lips....</p>

<p class='c011'>As an audience William was tough stuff. He
pretended deafness; he never looked. He did not
want to look. He seemed always to be holding
his nose in front of his face to prevent his observation—as
men pray into their hats at church.
But once Judy Bowles overheard a phrase or so
in his private soliloquy. “Pack o’ wimmin,”
William was saying. “Dratted petticoats. <em>Dang</em>
’em. That’s what I say to ’um. <em>Dang</em> ’em!”</p>

<p class='c011'>As a matter of fact, he just fell short of saying
it to them. But his manner said it....</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>You begin to see how acceptable an addition
was young Bealby to this company. He was not
only helpful, immensely helpful, in things material,
a vigorous and at first a careful washer-up, an
energetic boot-polisher, a most serviceable cleaner
and tidier of things, but he was also belief and
support. Undisguisedly he thought the caravan
the loveliest thing going, and its three mistresses
the most wonderful of people. His alert eyes followed
them about full of an unstinted admiration
and interest; he pricked his ears when Judy opened
her mouth, he handed things to Mrs. Geedge.
He made no secret about Madeleine. When she
spoke to him, he lost his breath, he reddened and
was embarrassed....</p>

<p class='c011'>They went across the fields saying that he was
the luckiest of finds. It was fortunate his people
had been so ready to spare him. Judy said boys
were a race very cruelly maligned; see how
<em>willing</em> he was! Mrs. Geedge said there was
something elfin about Bealby’s little face; Madeleine
smiled at the thought of his quaint artlessness.
She knew quite clearly that he’d die for
her....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 8</h3>

<p class='c010'>There was a little pause as the ladies moved
away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then William spat and spoke in a note of irrational
bitterness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Brasted Voolery,” said William, and then
loudly and fiercely, “Cam up, y’ode Runt you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At these words the white horse started into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>a convulsive irregular redistribution of its feet,
the caravan strained and quivered into motion
and Bealby’s wanderings as a caravanner began.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a time William spoke no more, and Bealby
scarcely regarded him. The light of strange
fortunes and deep enthusiasm was in Bealby’s
eyes....</p>

<p class='c011'>“One Thing,” said William, “they don’t ’ave
the Sense to lock anythink up—whatever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby’s attention was recalled to the existence
of his companion.</p>

<p class='c011'>William’s face was one of those faces that give
one at first the impression of a solitary and very
conceited nose. The other features are entirely
subordinated to that salient effect. One sees
them later. His eyes were small and uneven,
his mouth apparently toothless, thin-lipped and
crumpled, with the upper lip falling over the
other in a manner suggestive of a meagre firmness
mixed with appetite. When he spoke he made a
faint slobbering sound. “Everyfink,” he said,
“behind there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He became confidential. “I been <em>in</em> there.
I larked about wiv their Fings.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They got some choc’late,” he said, lusciously.
“Oo Fine!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All sorts of Fings.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not seem to expect any reply from
Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We going far before we meet ’em?” asked
Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>William’s deafness became apparent.</p>

<p class='c011'>His mind was preoccupied by other ideas. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>wicked eye came close to Bealby’s face. “We
going to ’ave a bit of choc’late,” he said in a wet
desirous voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>He pointed his thumb over his shoulder at the
door. “<em>You</em> get it,” said William with reassuring
nods and the mouth much pursed and very
oblique.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby shook his head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s in a little dror, under ’er place where she
sleeps.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby’s head-shake became more emphatic.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Yus</em>, I tell you,” said William.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” said Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Choc’late, I tell you,” said William, and ran the
tongue of appetite round the rim of his toothless
mouth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t want choc’late,” said Bealby, thinking
of a large lump of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go on,” said William. “Nobody won’t see
you....”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Go</em> it!” said William....</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’re afraid,” said William....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here, <em>I</em>’ll go,” said William, losing self-control.
“You just ’old these reins.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby took the reins. William got up and
opened the door of the caravan. Then Bealby
realized his moral responsibility—and, leaving
the reins, clutched William firmly by his baggy
nether garments. They were elderly garments,
much sat upon. “Don’t be a Vool,” said William
struggling. “Leago my slack.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Something partially gave way, and William’s
head came round to deal with Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“What you mean pullin’ my cloes orf me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That,”—he investigated. “Take me a Nour
to sew up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I ain’t going to steal,” shouted Bealby into
the ear of William.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nobody arst you to steal—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nor you neither,” said Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>The caravan bumped heavily against a low
garden wall, skidded a little and came to rest.
William sat down suddenly. The white horse,
after a period of confusion with its legs, tried the
flavour of some overhanging lilac branches and
was content.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gimme those reins,” said William. “You
be the Brastedest Young Vool....”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sittin’ ’ere,” said William presently, “chewin’
our teeth, when we might be eatin’ choc’late....”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I ’ent got no use for <em>you</em>,” said William,
“blowed if I ’ave....”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the thought of his injuries returned to
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d make you sew ’em up yourself, darned
if I wount—on’y you’d go running the brasted
needle into me.... Nour’s work there is—by
the feel of it.... Mor’n nour.... Goddobe
done, too.... All I got....”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll give you Sumpfin, you little Beace, ’fore I
done wi’ you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wouldn’t steal ’er choc’lates,” said young
Bealby, “not if I was starving.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eh?” shouted William.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Steal!</em>” shouted Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“I’ll steal ye, ’fore I done with ye,” said William.
“Tearin’ my cloes for me.... Oh! Cam <em>up</em>,
y’old Runt. We don’t want <em>you</em> to stop and
lissen. Cam <em>up</em>, I tell you!”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 8</h3>

<p class='c010'>They found the ladies rather, it seemed, by
accident than design, waiting upon a sandy
common rich with purple heather and bordered by
woods of fir and spruce. They had been waiting
some time, and it was clear that the sight of the
yellow caravan relieved an accumulated anxiety.
Bealby rejoiced to see them. His soul glowed
with the pride of chocolate resisted and William
overcome. He resolved to distinguish himself
over the preparation of the midday meal. It
was a pleasant little island of green they chose
for their midday pitch, a little patch of emerald
turf amidst the purple, a patch already doomed
to removal, as a bare oblong and a pile of rolled-up
turfs witnessed. This pile and a little bank of
heather and bramble promised shelter from the
breeze, and down the hill a hundred yards away
was a spring and a built-up pool. This spot
lay perhaps fifty yards away from the high
road and one reached it along a rutty track which
had been made by the turf cutters. And overhead
was the glorious sky of an English summer, with
great clouds like sunlit, white-sailed ships, the
Constable sky. The white horse was hobbled and
turned out to pasture among the heather, and
William was sent off to get congenial provender
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>at the nearest public house. “William!” shouted
Mrs. Bowles as he departed, shouting confidentially
into his ear, “Get your clothes mended.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eh?” said William.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mend your clothes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yah! ’E did that,” said William viciously
with a movement of self-protection, and so went.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nobody watched him go. Almost sternly they
set to work upon the luncheon preparation as
William receded. “William,” Mrs. Bowles remarked,
as she bustled with the patent cooker,
putting it up wrong way round so that afterwards
it collapsed, “William—takes offence. Sometimes
I think he takes offence almost too often....
Did you have any difficulty with him,
Dick?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It wasn’t anything, miss,” said Bealby meekly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby was wonderful with the firelighting, and
except that he cracked a plate in warming it,
quite admirable as a cook. He burnt his fingers
twice—and liked doing it; he ate his portion
with instinctive modesty on the other side of
the caravan and he washed up—as Mr. Mergleson
had always instructed him to do. Mrs.
Bowles showed him how to clean knives and forks
by sticking them into the turf. A little to his
surprise these ladies lit and smoked cigarettes.
They sat about and talked perplexingly. Clever
stuff. Then he had to get water from the neighbouring
brook and boil the kettle for an early
tea. Madeleine produced a charmingly bound
little book and read in it, the other two professed
themselves anxious for the view from a neighbouring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>hill. They produced their sensible spiked
walking sticks such as one does not see in England;
they seemed full of energy. “You go,” Madeleine
had said, “while I and Dick stay here and
make tea. I’ve walked enough to-day....”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Bealby, happy to the pitch of ecstacy, first
explored the wonderful interior of the caravan,—there
was a dresser, a stove, let-down chairs and
tables and all manner of things,—and then nursed
the kettle to the singing stage on the patent
cooker while the beautiful lady reclined close at
hand on a rug.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dick!” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had forgotten he was Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dick!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He remembered his personality with a start.
“Yes, miss!” He knelt up, with a handful of
twigs in his hand and regarded her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Well</em>, Dick,” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>He remained in flushed adoration. There was
a little pause and the lady smiled at him an unaffected
smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are you going to be, Dick, when you
grow up?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know, miss. I’ve wondered.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What would you like to be?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Something abroad. Something—so that you
could see things.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A soldier?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Or a sailor, miss.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A sailor sees nothing but the sea.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d rather be a sailor than a common soldier,
miss.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“You’d like to be an officer?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, miss—only—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One of my very best friends is an officer,”
she said, a little irrelevantly it seemed to Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d be a Norficer like a shot,” said Bealby,
“if I ’ad ’arf a chance, miss.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Officers nowadays,” she said, “have to be
very brave, able men.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know, miss,” said Bealby modestly....</p>

<p class='c011'>The fire required attention for a little while....</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady turned over on her elbow. “What
do you think you are <em>likely</em> to be, Dick!” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>He didn’t know.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What sort of man is your stepfather?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby looked at her. “He isn’t much,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is he?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby hadn’t the slightest intention of being
the son of a gardener. “’E’s a law-writer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What! in that village.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’E ’as to stay there for ’is ’ealth, miss,” he
said. “Every summer. ’Is ’ealth is very pre-precocious,
miss....”</p>

<p class='c011'>He fed his fire with a few judiciously administered
twigs.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What was your own father, Dick?”</p>

<p class='c011'>With that she opened a secret door in Bealby’s
imagination. All stepchildren have those dreams.
With him they were so frequent and vivid that
they had long since become a kind of second
truth. He coloured a little and answered with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>scarcely an interval for reflection. “’E passed
as Mal-travers,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wasn’t that his name?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t rightly know, miss. There was
always something kep’ from me. My mother
used to say, ‘Artie,’ she used to say: ‘there’s
things that some day you must know, things
that concern you. Things about your farver.
But poor as we are now and struggling....
Not yet.... Some day you shall know truly—<em>who
you are</em>.’ That was ’ow she said it, miss.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And she died before she told you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had almost forgotten that he had killed his
mother that very morning. “Yes, miss,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c011'>She smiled at him and something in her smile
made him blush hotly. For a moment he could
have believed she understood. And indeed, she
did understand, and it amused her to find this boy
doing—what she herself had done at times—what
indeed she felt it was still in her to do. She
felt that most delicate of sympathies, the sympathy
of one rather over-imaginative person for
another. But her next question dispelled his
doubt of her though it left him red and hot. She
asked it with a convincing simplicity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you any idea, Dick, have you any
guess or suspicion, I mean, who it is you really
are?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish I had, miss,” he said. “I suppose it
doesn’t matter, really—but one can’t help
wondering....”</p>

<p class='c011'>How often he had wondered in his lonely wanderings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>through that dear city of day-dreams where
all the people one knows look out of windows as
one passes and the roads are paved with pride!
How often had he decided and changed and decided
again!</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 9</h3>

<p class='c010'>Now suddenly a realization of intrusion
shattered this conversation. A third person stood
over the little encampment, smiling mysteriously
and waving a cleek in a slow hieratic manner
through the air.</p>

<p class='c011'>“De licious lill’ corn’,” said the newcomer in
tones of benediction.</p>

<p class='c011'>He met their enquiring eyes with a luxurious
smile, “Licious,” he said, and remained swaying
insecurely and failing to express some imperfectly
apprehended deep meaning by short peculiar
movements of the cleek.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was obviously a golfer astray from some
adjacent course—and he had lunched.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mighty Join you,” he said, and then very distinctly
in a full large voice, “Miss Malleleine
Philps.” There are the penalties of a public and
popular life.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’s <em>drunk</em>,” the lady whispered. “Get him
to go away, Dick. I can’t endure drunken men.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She stood up and Bealby stood up. He advanced
in front of her, slowly with his nose in
the air, extraordinarily like a small terrier smelling
at a strange dog.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I said Mighty Join you,” the golfer repeated.
His voice was richly excessive. He was a big
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>heavy man with a short-cropped moustache, a
great deal of neck and dewlap and a solemn
expression.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Prup. Be’r. Introzuze m’self,” he remarked.
He tried to indicate himself by waving his hand
towards himself, but finally abandoned the attempt
as impossible. “Ma’ Goo’ Soch’l Poshishun,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby had a disconcerting sense of retreating
footsteps behind him. He glanced over his
shoulder and saw Miss Philips standing at the
foot of the steps that led up to the fastnesses
of the caravan. “Dick,” she cried with a sharp
note of alarm in her voice, “get rid of that man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A moment after Bealby heard the door shut and
a sound of a key in its lock. He concealed his
true feelings by putting his arms akimbo, sticking
his legs wider apart and contemplating the task
before him with his head a little on one side. He
was upheld by the thought that the yellow caravan
had a window looking upon him....</p>

<p class='c011'>The newcomer seemed to consider the ceremony
of introduction completed. “<em>I</em> done care for
goff,” he said, almost vaingloriously.</p>

<p class='c011'>He waved his cleek to express his preference.
“Natua,” he said with a satisfaction that bordered
on fatuity.</p>

<p class='c011'>He prepared to come down from the little turfy
crest on which he stood to the encampment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Ere!” said Bealby. “This is Private.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The golfer indicated by solemn movements
of the cleek that this was understood but that
other considerations overrode it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“You—You got to go!” cried Bealby in a
breathless squeak. “You get out of here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The golfer waved an arm as who should say,
“You do not understand, but I forgive you,”
and continued to advance towards the fire.
And then Bealby, at the end of his tact, commenced
hostilities.</p>

<p class='c011'>He did so because he felt he had to do something,
and he did not know what else to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wan’ nothin’ but frenly conversation sushus
custm’ry webred peel,” the golfer was saying, and
then a large fragment of turf hit him in the neck,
burst all about him and stopped him abruptly.</p>

<p class='c011'>He remained for some lengthy moments too
astonished for words. He was not only greatly
surprised, but he chose to appear even more
surprised than he was. In spite of the brown-black
mould upon his cheek and brow and a
slight displacement of his cap, he achieved a sort
of dignity. He came slowly to a focus upon
Bealby, who stood by the turf pile grasping a
second missile. The cleek was extended sceptre-wise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Replace the—Divot.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You go orf,” said Bealby. “I’ll chuck it if
you don’t. I tell you fair.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Replace the—<span class='sc'>Divot</span>,” roared the golfer again
in a voice of extraordinary power.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You—you go!” said Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Am I t’ask you. Third time. Reshpect—Roos....
Replace the Divot.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It struck him fully in the face.</p>

<p class='c011'>He seemed to emerge through the mould. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>was blinking but still dignified. “Tha’—was
intentional,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>He seemed to gather himself together....</p>

<p class='c011'>Then suddenly and with a surprising nimbleness
he discharged himself at Bealby. He came with
astonishing swiftness. He got within a foot of
him. Well, it was for Bealby that he had learnt
to dodge in the village playground. He went
down under the golfer’s arm and away round
the end of the stack, and the golfer with his
force spent in concussion remained for a time
clinging to the turf pile and apparently trying to
remember how he got there. Then he was reminded
of recent occurrences by a shrill small
voice from the other side of the stack.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You gow away!” said the voice. “Can’t
you see you’re annoying a lady? You gow away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nowish—’noy anyone. Pease wall wirl.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But this was subterfuge. He meant to catch
that boy. Suddenly and rather brilliantly he
turned the flank of the turf pile and only a couple of
loose turfs at the foot of the heap upset his calculations.
He found himself on all fours on ground
from which it was difficult to rise. But he did
not lose heart. “Boy—hic—scow,” he said, and
became for a second rush a nimble quadruped.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again he got quite astonishingly near to Bealby,
and then in an instant was on his feet and running
across the encampment after him. He succeeded
in kicking over the kettle, and the patent cooker,
without any injury to himself or loss of pace,
and succumbed only to the sharp turn behind the
end of the caravan and the steps. He hadn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>somehow thought of the steps. So he went down
rather heavily. But now the spirit of a fine man
was roused. Regardless of the scream from
inside that had followed his collapse, he was up
and in pursuit almost instantly. Bealby only
escaped the swiftness of his rush by jumping the
shafts and going away across the front of the caravan
to the turf pile again. The golfer tried to
jump the shafts too, but he was not equal to
that. He did in a manner jump. But it was almost
as much diving as jumping. And there was
something in it almost like the curvetting of a
Great Horse....</p>

<p class='c011'>When Bealby turned at the crash, the golfer
was already on all fours again and trying very
busily to crawl out between the shaft and the
front wheel. He would have been more successful
in doing this if he had not begun by putting his
arm through the wheel. As it was, he was trying
to do too much; he was trying to crawl out at
two points at once and getting very rapidly
annoyed at his inability to do so. The caravan
was shifting slowly forward....</p>

<p class='c011'>It was manifest to Bealby that getting this man
to go was likely to be a much more lengthy business
than he had supposed.</p>

<p class='c011'>He surveyed the situation for a moment, and
then realizing the entanglement of his opponent,
he seized a camp-stool by one leg, went round by
the steps and attacked the prostrate enemy
from the rear with effectual but inconclusive
fury. He hammered....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Steady on, young man,” said a voice, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>was seized from behind. He turned—to discover
himself in the grip of a second golfer....</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Another!</em> Bealby fought in a fury of fear....</p>

<p class='c011'>He bit an arm—rather too tweedy to feel much—and
got in a couple of shinners—alas! that
they were only slippered shinners!—before he
was overpowered....</p>

<p class='c011'>A cuffed, crumpled, disarmed and panting
Bealby found himself watching the careful extraction
of the first golfer from the front wheel.
Two friends assisted that gentleman with a
reproachful gentleness, and his repeated statements
that he was all right seemed to reassure
them greatly. Altogether there were now four
golfers in the field, counting the pioneer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was after this devil of a boy,” said the one
who held Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but how did he get here?” asked the man
who was gripping Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Feel better now?” said the third, helping the
first comer to his uncertain feet. “Let me have
your cleek o, man.... You won’t want your
cleek....”</p>

<p class='c011'>Across the heather, lifting their heads a little,
came Mrs. Bowles and Mrs. Geedge, returning
from their walk. They were wondering whoever
their visitors could be.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then like music after a dispute came
Madeleine Philips, a beautiful blue-robed thing,
coming slowly with a kind of wonder on her face,
out of the caravan and down the steps. Instinctively
everybody turned to her. The drunkard
with a gesture released himself from his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>supporter and stood erect. His cap was replaced
upon him—obliquely. His cleek had
been secured.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I heard a noise,” said Madeleine, lifting her
pretty chin and speaking in her sweetest tones.
She looked her enquiries....</p>

<p class='c011'>She surveyed the three sober men with a practised
eye. She chose the tallest, a fair, serious-looking
young man standing conveniently at
the drunkard’s elbow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you please take your friend away,” she
said, indicating the offender with her beautiful
white hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Simly,” he said in a slightly subdued voice,
“simly coring.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Everybody tried for a moment to understand
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look here, old man, you’ve got no business
here,” said the fair young man. “You’d better
come back to the club house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The drunken man stuck to his statement.
“Simly coring,” he said a little louder.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I <em>think</em>,” said a little bright-eyed man with a
very cheerful yellow vest, “I <em>think</em> he’s apologizing.
I <em>hope</em> so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The drunken man nodded his head. That
among other matters.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tall young man took his arm, but he insisted
on his point. “Simly coring,” he said
with emphasis. “If—if—done <em>wan’</em> me to cor.
Notome. Nottot.... Mean’ say. Nottot
tat-tome. Nottotome. Orny way—sayin’
not-ome. No wish ’trude. No wish ’all.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“Well, then, you see, you’d better come away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I <em>ars’</em> you—are you <em>tome</em>? Miss—Miss
Pips.” He appealed to Miss Philips.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you’d answer him—” said the tall young
man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir,” she said with great dignity and the
pretty chin higher than ever. “I am <em>not</em> at
home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nuthin’ more t’ say then,” said the drunken
man, and with a sudden stoicism he turned away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come,” he said, submitting to support.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Simly orny arfnoon cor,” he said generally
and permitted himself to be led off.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Orny frenly cor....”</p>

<p class='c011'>For some time he was audible as he receded,
explaining in a rather condescending voice the
extreme social correctness of his behaviour. Just
for a moment or so there was a slight tussle, due
to his desire to return and leave cards....</p>

<p class='c011'>He was afterwards seen to be distributing a
small handful of visiting cards amidst the heather
with his free arm, rather in the manner of a paper
chase—but much more gracefully....</p>

<p class='c011'>Then decently and in order he was taken out of
sight....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 10</h3>

<p class='c010'>Bealby had been unostentatiously released by his
captor as soon as Miss Philips appeared, and the
two remaining golfers now addressed themselves
to the three ladies in regret and explanation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The man who had held Bealby was an aquiline
grey-clad person with a cascade moustache and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>wrinkled eyes, and for some obscure reason he
seemed to be amused; the little man in the yellow
vest, however, was quite earnest and serious
enough to make up for him. He was one of
those little fresh-coloured men whose faces stick
forward openly. He had open projecting eyes,
an open mouth, his cheeks were frank to the pitch
of ostentation, his cap was thrust back from his
exceptionally open forehead. He had a chest
and a stomach. There, too, he held out. He
would have held out anything. His legs leant
forward from the feet. It was evidently impossible
for a man of his nature to be anything
but clean shaved....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Our fault entirely,” he said. “Ought to
have looked after him. Can’t say how sorry
and ashamed we are. Can’t say how sorry we
are he caused you any inconvenience.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course,” said Mrs. Bowles, “our boy-servant
ought not to have pelted him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He didn’t exactly <em>pelt</em> him, dear,” said Madeleine....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, anyhow our friend ought not to have
been off his chain. It was our affair to look after
him and we didn’t....</p>

<p class='c011'>“You see,” the open young man went on, with
the air of lucid explanation, “he’s our worst
player. And he got round in a hundred and
twenty-seven. And beat—somebody. And—it’s
upset him. It’s not a bit of good disguising
that we’ve been letting him drink....
We have. To begin with, we encouraged him....
We oughtn’t to have let him go. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>we thought a walk alone might do him good.
And some of us were a bit off him. Fed up
rather. You see he’d been singing, would go on
singing....”</p>

<p class='c011'>He went on to propitiations. “Anything the
club can do to show how we regret.... If
you would like to pitch—later on in our rough
beyond the pinewoods.... You’d find it safe
and secluded.... Custodian—most civil man.
Get you water or anything you wanted. Especially
after all that has happened....”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby took no further part in these concluding
politenesses. He had a curious feeling in his
mind that perhaps he had not managed this
affair quite so well as he might have done. He
ought to have been more tactful like, more persuasive.
He was a fool to have started chucking....
Well, well. He picked up the overturned
kettle and went off down the hill to get
water....</p>

<p class='c011'>What had she thought of him?...</p>

<p class='c011'>In the meantime one can at least boil kettles.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 11</h3>

<p class='c010'>One consequence of this little incident of the
rejoicing golfer was that the three ladies were no
longer content to dismiss William and Bealby
at nightfall and sleep unprotected in the caravan.
And this time their pitch was a lonely one with
only the golf club house within call. They were
inclined even to distrust the golf club. So it
was decided, to his great satisfaction, that Bealby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>should have a certain sleeping sack Mrs. Bowles
had brought with her and that he should sleep
therein between the wheels.</p>

<p class='c011'>This sleeping sack was to have been a great
feature of the expedition, but when it came to
the test Judy could not use it. She had not anticipated
that feeling of extreme publicity the
open air gives one at first. It was like having
all the world in one’s bedroom. Every night
she had relapsed into the caravan.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby did not mind what they did with him
so long as it meant sleeping. He had had a
long day of it. He undressed sketchily and
wriggled into the nice woolly bag and lay for a
moment listening to the soft bumpings that were
going on overhead. <em>She</em> was there. He had
the instinctive confidence of our sex in women,
and here were three of them. He had a vague
idea of getting out of his bag again and kissing
the underside of the van that held this dear
beautiful creature....</p>

<p class='c011'>He didn’t....</p>

<p class='c011'>Such a lot of things had happened that day—and
the day before. He had been going without
intermission, it seemed now for endless hours.
He thought of trees, roads, dew-wet grass, frying-pans,
pursuing packs of gigantic butlers hopelessly
at fault,—no doubt they were hunting
now—chinks and crannies, tactless missiles flying,
bursting, missiles it was vain to recall. He
stared for a few seconds through the wheel spokes
at the dancing, crackling fire of pine-cones which
it had been his last duty to replenish, stared and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>blinked much as a little dog might do and then he
had slipped away altogether into the world of
dreams....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 12</h3>

<p class='c010'>In the morning he was extraordinarily hard to
wake....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it after sleeping all day ye’d be?” cried
Judy Bowles, who was always at her most Irish
about breakfast time.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>THE UNOBTRUSIVE PARTING</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 1</h3>

<p class='c010'>Monday was a happy day for Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>The caravan did seventeen miles and came to
rest at last in a sloping field outside a cheerful
little village set about a green on which was a
long tent professing to be a theatre.... At
the first stopping-place that possessed a general
shop Mrs. Bowles bought Bealby a pair of boots.
Then she had a bright idea. “Got any pocket
money, Dick?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>She gave him half a crown, that is to say she
gave him two shillings and sixpence, or five
sixpences or thirty pennies—according as you
choose to look at it—in one large undivided
shining coin.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even if he had not been in love, here surely was
incentive to a generous nature to help and do
distinguished services. He dashed about doing
things. The little accident on Sunday had
warned him to be careful of the plates, and the
only flaw upon a perfect day’s service was the
dropping of an egg on its way to the frying pan
for supper. It remained where it fell and there
presently he gave it a quiet burial. There was
nothing else to be done with it....</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>All day long at intervals Miss Philips smiled
at him and made him do little services for her.
And in the evening, after the custom of her
great profession when it keeps holiday, she insisted
on going to the play. She said it would
be the loveliest fun. She went with Mrs. Bowles
because Mrs. Geedge wanted to sit quietly in
the caravan and write down a few little things
while they were still fresh in her mind. And
it wasn’t in the part of Madeleine Philips not to
insist that both William and Bealby must go
too; she gave them each a shilling—though
the prices were sixpence, threepence, two-pence
and a penny—and Bealby saw his first real
play.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was called <cite>Brothers in Blood, or the Gentleman
Ranker</cite>. There was a poster—which was only
very slightly justified by the performance—of
a man in khaki with a bandaged head proposing
to sell his life dearly over a fallen comrade.</p>

<p class='c011'>One went to the play through an open and
damaged field gate and across trampled turf.
Outside the tent were two paraffin flares illuminating
the poster and a small cluster of the impecunious
young. Within on grass that was worn and
bleached were benches, a gathering audience, a
piano played by an off-hand lady, and a drop
scene displaying the Grand Canal, Venice. The
Grand Canal was infested by a crowded multitude
of zealous and excessive reflections of the palaces
above and by peculiar crescentic black boats
floating entirely out of water and having no
reflections at all. The off-hand lady gave a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>broad impression of the wedding march in Lohengrin,
and the back seats assisted by a sort of
gastric vocalization called humming and by
whistling between the teeth. Madeleine Philips
evidently found it tremendous fun, even before
the curtain rose.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then—illusion....</p>

<p class='c011'>The scenery was ridiculous; it waved about,
the actors and actresses were surely the most pitiful
of their tribe and every invention in the play
impossible, but the imagination of Bealby, like the
loving kindness of God, made no difficulties; it
rose and met and embraced and gave life to all
these things. It was a confused story in the play,
everybody was more or less somebody else all
the way through, and it got more confused in
Bealby’s mind, but it was clear from the outset
that there was vile work afoot, nets spread and
sweet simple people wronged. And never were
sweet and simple people quite so sweet and simple.
There was the wrongful brother who was weak
and wicked and the rightful brother who was
vindictively, almost viciously, good, and there was
an ingrained villain who was a baronet, a man
who wore a frock coat and a silk hat and carried
gloves and a stick in every scene and upon all
occasions—that sort of man. He looked askance,
always. There was a dear simple girl, with a vast
sweet smile, who was loved according to their
natures by the wrongful and the rightful brother,
and a large wicked red-clad, lip-biting woman
whose passions made the crazy little stage quiver.
There was a comic butler—very different stuff
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>from old Mergleson—who wore an evening coat
and plaid trousers and nearly choked Bealby.
Why weren’t all butlers like that? Funny.
And there were constant denunciations. Always
there were denunciations going on or denunciations
impending. That took Bealby particularly.
Never surely in all the world were bad
people so steadily and thoroughly scolded and
told what. Everybody hissed them; Bealby
hissed them. And when they were told what,
he applauded. And yet they kept on with
their wickedness to the very curtain. They
retired—askance to the end. Foiled but pursuing.
“A time will come,” they said.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a moment in the distresses of the
heroine when Bealby dashed aside a tear. And
then at last most wonderfully it all came right.
The company lined up and hoped that Bealby
was satisfied. Bealby wished he had more hands.
His heart seemed to fill his body. Oh <em>prime!
prime!...</em></p>

<p class='c011'>And out he came into the sympathetic night.
But he was no longer a trivial Bealby; his soul
was purged, he was a strong and silent man,
ready to explode into generous repartee or nerve
himself for high endeavour. He slipped off in
the opposite direction from the caravan because
he wanted to be alone for a time and <em>feel</em>.
He did not want to jar upon a sphere of glorious
illusion that had blown up in his mind like a
bubble....</p>

<p class='c011'>He was quite sure that he had been wronged.
Not to be wronged is to forego the first privilege
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>of goodness. He had been deeply wronged by
a plot,—all those butlers were in the plot or
why should they have chased him,—he was
much older than he really was, it had been kept
from him, and in truth he was a rightful earl.
“Earl Shonts,” he whispered; and indeed, why
not? And Madeleine too had been wronged;
she had been reduced to wander in this uncomfortable
caravan; this Gipsy Queen; she had
been brought to it by villains, the same villains
who had wronged Bealby....</p>

<p class='c011'>Out he went into the night, the kindly consenting
summer night, where there is nothing to be
seen or heard that will contradict these delicious
wonderful persuasions.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was so full of these dreams that he strayed
far away along the dark country lanes and had
at last the utmost difficulty in finding his way
back to the caravan. And when ultimately he got
back after hours and hours of heroic existence it
did not even seem that they had missed him. It
did not seem that he had been away half an
hour.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 2</h3>

<p class='c010'>Tuesday was not so happy a day for Bealby
as Monday.</p>

<p class='c011'>Its shadows began when Mrs. Bowles asked
him in a friendly tone when it was clean-collar day.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was unready with his answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And don’t you ever use a hair brush, Dick?”
she asked. “I’m sure now there’s one in your
parcel.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“I do use it <em>sometimes</em>, Mum,” he admitted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I’ve never detected you with a toothbrush
yet. Though that perhaps is extreme.
And Dick—soap? I think you’d better be letting
me give you a cake of soap.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d be very much obliged, Mum.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hardly dare hint, Dick, at a clean handkerchief.
Such things are known.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you wouldn’t mind—when I’ve got the
breakfast things done, Mum....”</p>

<p class='c011'>The thing worried him all through breakfast.
He had not expected—personalities from Mrs.
Bowles. More particularly personalities of this
kind. He felt he had to think hard.</p>

<p class='c011'>He affected modesty after he had cleared away
breakfast and carried off his little bundle to a
point in the stream which was masked from the
encampment by willows. With him he also
brought that cake of soap. He began by washing
his handkerchief, which was bad policy because that
left him no dry towel but his jacket. He ought,
he perceived, to have secured a dish-cloth or a
newspaper. (This he must remember on the
next occasion.) He did over his hands and the
more exposed parts of his face with soap and
jacket. Then he took off and examined his collar.
It certainly was pretty bad....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why!” cried Mrs. Bowles when he returned,
“that’s still the same collar.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They all seem to’ve got crumpled ’m,” said
Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But are they all as dirty?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I ’ad some blacking in my parcel,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Bealby, “and it got loose, Mum. I’ll have to
get another collar when we come to a shop.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a financial sacrifice, but it was the only
way, and when they came to the shop Bealby
secured a very nice collar indeed, high with
pointed turn-down corners, so that it cut his
neck all round, jabbed him under the chin and
gave him a proud upcast carriage of the head
that led to his treading upon and very completely
destroying a stray plate while preparing lunch.
But it was more of a man’s collar, he felt, than
anything he had ever worn before. And it cost
sixpence halfpenny, six dee and a half.</p>

<p class='c011'>(I should have mentioned that while washing
up the breakfast things he had already broken
the handle off one of the breakfast cups. Both
these accidents deepened the cloud upon his day.)</p>

<p class='c011'>And then there was the trouble of William.
William having meditated upon the differences
between them for a day had now invented an
activity. As Bealby sat beside him behind the
white horse he was suddenly and frightfully
pinched. <em>Gee!</em> One wanted to yelp.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Choc’late,” said William through his teeth
and very very savagely. “<em>Now</em> then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>After William had done that twice Bealby
preferred to walk beside the caravan. Thereupon
William whipped up the white horse and
broke records and made all the crockery sing together
and forced the pace until he was spoken
to by Mrs. Bowles....</p>

<p class='c011'>It was upon a Bealby thus depressed and
worried that the rumour of impending “men-folk”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>came. It began after the party had stopped
for letters at a village post office; there were
not only letters but a telegram, that Mrs. Bowles
read with her spats far apart and her head on
one side. “Ye’d like to know about it,” she said
waggishly to Miss Philips, “and you just shan’t.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She then went into her letters.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ve got some news,” said Mrs. Geedge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have that,” said Mrs. Bowles, and not a
word more could they get from her....</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll keep my news no longer,” said Mrs.
Bowles, lighting her cigarette after lunch as
Bealby hovered about clearing away the banana
skins and suchlike vestiges of dessert. “To-morrow
night as ever is, if so be we get to Winthorpe-Sutbury,
there’ll be Men among us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But Tom’s not coming,” said Mrs. Geedge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He asked Tim to tell me to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you’ve kept it these two hours, Judy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For your own good and peace of mind. But
now the murther’s out. Come they will, your
Man and my Man, pretending to a pity because
they can’t do without us. But like the self-indulgent
monsters they are, they must needs
stop at some grand hotel, Redlake he calls it,
the Royal, on the hill above Winthorpe-Sutbury.
The Royal! The very name describes it. Can’t
you see the lounge, girls, with its white cane
chairs? And saddlebacks! No other hotel it
seems is good enough for them, and we if you
please are asked to go in and have—what does
the man call it—the ‘comforts of decency’—and
let the caravan rest for a bit.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“Tim promised me I should run wild as long
as I chose,” said Mrs. Geedge, looking anything
but wild.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They’re after thinking we’ve had enough of
it,” said Mrs. Bowles.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It sounds like that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure I’d go on like this for ever,” said Judy.
“’Tis the Man and the House and all of it that
oppresses me. Vans for Women....”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let’s not go to Winthorpe-Sutbury,” said
Madeleine.</p>

<p class='c011'>(The first word of sense Bealby had heard.)</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” said Mrs. Bowles archly, “who knows
but what there’ll be a Man for you? Some
sort of Man anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>(Bealby thought that a most improper remark.)</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want no man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why do you say <em>Ah</em> like that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I mean <em>Ah</em> like that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Meaning?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Philips eyed Mrs. Bowles and Mrs. Bowles
eyed Miss Philips.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Judy,” she said, “you’ve got something up
your sleeve.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where it’s perfectly comfortable,” said Mrs.
Bowles.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then quite maddeningly, she remarked,
“Will you be after washing up presently, Dick?”
and looked at him with a roguish quiet over her
cigarette. It was necessary to disabuse her
mind at once of the idea that he had been listening.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>He took up the last few plates and went
off to the washing place by the stream. All the
rest of that conversation <em>had</em> to be lost.</p>

<p class='c011'>Except that as he came back for the Hudson’s
soap he heard Miss Philips say, “Keep your old
Men. I’ll just console myself with Dick, my
dears. Making such a Mystery!”</p>

<p class='c011'>To which Mrs. Bowles replied darkly, “She
<em>little</em> knows....”</p>

<p class='c011'>A kind of consolation was to be got from that....
But what was it she little knew?...</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 3</h3>

<p class='c010'>The men-folk when they came were nothing
so terrific to the sight as Bealby had expected.
And thank Heaven there were only two of them
and each assigned. Something he perceived was
said about someone else, he couldn’t quite catch
what, but if there was to have been someone
else, at any rate there now wasn’t. Professor
Bowles was animated and Mr. Geedge was gracefully
cold, they kissed their wives but not offensively,
and there was a chattering pause while
Bealby walked on beside the caravan. They
were on the bare road that runs along the high
ridge above Winthorpe-Sutbury, and the men
had walked to meet them from some hotel or
other—Bealby wasn’t clear about that—by
the golf links. Judy was the life and soul of the
encounter, and all for asking the men what they
meant by intruding upon three independent
women who, sure-alive, could very well do without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>them. Professor Bowles took her pretty
calmly, and seemed on the whole to admire her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Professor Bowles was a compact little man
wearing spectacles with alternative glasses, partly
curved, partly flat; he was hairy and dressed in
that sort of soft tweedy stuff that ravels out—he
seemed to have been sitting among thorns—and
baggy knickerbockers with straps and very
thick stockings and very sensible, open air, in
fact quite mountainous, boots. And yet though
he was short and stout and active he had a kind
of authority about him, and it was clear that for
all her persuasiveness his wife merely ran over
him like a creeper without making any great
difference to him. “I’ve found,” he said, “the
perfect place for your encampment.” She had
been making suggestions. And presently he left
the ladies and came hurrying after the caravan to
take control.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was evidently a very controlling person.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here, you get down,” he said to William.
“That poor beast’s got enough to pull without
<em>you</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And when William mumbled he said, “Hey?”
in such a shout that William for ever after held
his peace.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where d’you come from, you boy, you?”
he asked suddenly, and Bealby looked to Mrs.
Bowles to explain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Great silly collar you’ve got,” said the Professor,
interrupting her reply. “Boy like this
ought to wear a wool shirt. Dirty too. Take it
off, boy. It’s choking you. Don’t you <em>feel</em> it?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Then he went on to make trouble about the
tackle William had rigged to contain the white
horse.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This harness makes me sick,” said Professor
Bowles. “It’s worse than Italy....”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” he cried and suddenly darted off across
the turf, going inelegantly and very rapidly,
with peculiar motions of the head and neck as
he brought first the flat and then the curved
surface of his glasses into play. Finally he
dived into the turf, remained scrabbling on all
fours for a moment or so, became almost still
for the fraction of a minute and then got up and
returned to his wife, holding in an exquisite manner
something that struggled between his finger
and his thumb.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s the third to-day,” he said, triumphantly.
“They swarm here. It’s a migration.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he resumed his penetrating criticism of
the caravan outfit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That boy,” he said suddenly with his glasses
oblique, “hasn’t taken off his collar yet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby revealed the modest secrets of his neck
and pocketed the collar....</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Geedge did not appear to observe Bealby.
He was a man of the super-aquiline type with a
nose like a rudder, he held his face as if it was
a hatchet in a procession, and walked with the
dignity of a man of honour. You could see at
once he was a man of honour. Inflexibly, invincibly,
he was a man of honour. You felt that
anywhen, in a fire, in an earthquake, in a railway
accident when other people would be running
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>about and doing things he would have remained—a
man of honour. It was his pride rather than
his vanity to be mistaken for Sir Edward Grey.
He now walked along with Miss Philips and his
wife behind the disputing Bowleses, and discoursed
in deep sonorous tones about the healthiness
of healthy places and the stifling feeling one
had in towns when there was no air.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 4</h3>

<p class='c010'>The Professor was remarkably active when at
last the point he had chosen for the encampment
was reached. Bealby was told to “look alive”
twice, and William was assigned to his genus and
species; “The man’s an absolute idiot,” was the
way the Professor put it. William just shot a
glance at him over his nose. The place certainly
commanded a wonderful view. It was a turfy
bank protected from the north and south by
bushes of yew and the beech-bordered edge of
a chalk pit; it was close beside the road, a road
which went steeply down the hill into Winthorpe-Sutbury,
with that intrepid decision peculiar to
the hill-roads of the south of England. It looked
indeed as though you could throw the rinse of your
teacups into the Winthorpe-Sutbury street; as
if you could jump and impale yourself upon the
church spire. The hills bellied out east and
west and carried hangers, and then swept round
to the west in a long level succession of projections,
a perspective that merged at last with the
general horizon of hilly bluenesses, amidst which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Professor Bowles insisted upon a “sapphire
glimpse” of sea. “The Channel,” said Professor
Bowles, as though that made it easier for
them. Only Mr. Geedge refused to see even
that mitigated version of the sea. There was
something perhaps bluish and level, but he was
evidently not going to admit it was sea until he
had paddled in it and tested it in every way
known to him....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good <em>Lord</em>!” cried the Professor. “What’s
the man doing now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>William stopped the struggles and confidential
discouragements he was bestowing upon the
white horse and waited for a more definite reproach.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Putting the caravan alongside to the sun!
Do you think it will ever get cool again? And
think of the blaze of the sunset—through the
glass of that door!”</p>

<p class='c011'>William spluttered. “If I put’n tother way—goo
runnin’ down t’hill like,” said William.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Imbecile!” cried the Professor. “Put something
under the wheels. <em>Here!</em>” He careered
about and produced great grey fragments of a
perished yew tree. “Now then,” he said. “Head
up hill.”</p>

<p class='c011'>William did his best.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! <em>not</em> like that! Here, <em>you</em>!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby assisted with obsequious enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was some time before the caravan was adjusted
to the complete satisfaction of the Professor.
But at last it was done, and the end door gaped at
the whole prospect of the Weald with the steps hanging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>out idiotically like a tongue. The hind wheels
were stayed up very cleverly by lumps of chalk and
chunks of yew, living and dead, and certainly the
effect of it was altogether taller and better. And
then the preparations for the midday cooking began.
The Professor was full of acute ideas about camping
and cooking, and gave Bealby a lively but instructive
time. There was no stream handy, but
William was sent off to the hotel to fetch a garden
water-cart that the Professor with infinite foresight
had arranged should be ready.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Geedges held aloof from these preparations,—they
were unassuming people; Miss Philips
concentrated her attention upon the Weald—it
seemed to Bealby a little discontentedly—as
if it was unworthy of her—and Mrs. Bowles
hovered smoking cigarettes over her husband’s
activities, acting great amusement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You see it pleases me to get Himself busy,”
she said. “You’ll end a Camper yet, Darlint,
and us in the hotel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Professor answered nothing, but seemed
to plunge deeper into practicality.</p>

<p class='c011'>Under the urgency of Professor Bowles Bealby
stumbled and broke a glass jar of marmalade
over some fried potatoes, but otherwise did well
as a cook’s assistant. Once things were a little
interrupted by the Professor going off to catch a
cricket, but whether it was the right sort of
cricket or not he failed to get it. And then with
three loud reports—for a moment Bealby thought
the mad butlers from Shonts were upon him with
firearms—Captain Douglas arrived and got off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>his motor bicycle and left it by the roadside.
His machine accounted for his delay, for those
were the early days of motor bicycles. It also
accounted for a black smudge under one of his
bright little eyes. He was fair and flushed,
dressed in oilskins and a helmet-shaped cap and
great gauntlets that made him, in spite of the
smudge, look strange and brave and handsome,
like a Crusader—only that he was clad in oilskin
and not steel, and his moustache was smaller than
those Crusaders wore; and when he came
across the turf to the encampment Mrs. Bowles
and Mrs. Geedge both set up a cry of “A-<em>Ah</em>!”
and Miss Philips turned an accusing face upon
those two ladies. Bealby knelt with a bunch of
knives and forks in his hand, laying the cloth
for lunch, and when he saw Captain Douglas
approaching Miss Philips, he perceived clearly
that that lady had already forgotten her lowly
adorer, and his little heart was smitten with
desolation. This man was arrayed like a chivalrous
god, and how was a poor Bealby, whose very
collar, his one little circlet of manhood, had been
reft from him, how was he to compete with this
tremendousness? In that hour the ambition for
mechanism, the passion for leather and oilskin,
was sown in Bealby’s heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I told you not to come near me for a month,”
said Madeleine, but her face was radiant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These motor bicycles—very difficult to control,”
said Captain Douglas, and all the little
golden-white hairs upon his sunlit cheek glittered
in the sun.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“And besides,” said Mrs. Bowles, “it’s all
nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Professor was in a state of arrested administration;
the three others were frankly
audience to a clearly understood scene.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You ought to be in France.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m not in France.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I sent you into exile for a month,” and she
held out a hand for the captain to kiss.</p>

<p class='c011'>He kissed it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Someday, somewhere, it was written in the
book of destiny Bealby should also kiss hands.
It was a lovely thing to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Month! It’s been years,” said the captain.
“Years and years.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you ought to have come back before,”
she replied and the captain had no answer
ready....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 5</h3>

<p class='c010'>When William arrived with the water-cart, he
brought also further proofs of the Professor’s
organizing ability. He brought various bottles
of wine, red Burgundy and sparkling hock, two
bottles of cider, and peculiar and meritorious
waters; he brought tinned things for <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors d’œuvre</span></i>;
he brought some luscious pears. When he had
a moment with Bealby behind the caravan he
repeated thrice in tones of hopeless sorrow,
“They’ll eat um all. I <em>knows</em> they’ll eat um all.”
And then plumbing a deeper deep of woe, “Ef
they <em>don’t</em> they’ll count um. Ode Goggles’ll bag
um.... E’s a <em>bagger</em>, ’e is.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>It was the brightest of luncheons that was
eaten that day in the sunshine and spaciousness
above Winthorpe-Sutbury. Everyone was gay,
and even the love-torn Bealby, who might well
have sunk into depression and lethargy, was
galvanized into an activity that was almost
cheerful by flashes from the Professor’s glasses.
They talked of this and that; Bealby hadn’t
much time to attend, though the laughter that
followed various sallies from Judy Bowles was
very tantalizing, and it had come to the pears
before his attention wasn’t so much caught as
felled by the word “Shonts.”... It was as
if the sky had suddenly changed to vermilion.
<em>All these people were talking of Shonts!...</em></p>

<p class='c011'>“Went there,” said Captain Douglas, “in
perfect good faith. Wanted to fill up Lucy’s
little party. One doesn’t go to Shonts nowadays
for idle pleasure. And then—I get ordered out
of the house, absolutely Told to Go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>(This man had been at Shonts!)</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was on Sunday morning?” said Mrs.
Geedge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On Sunday morning,” said Mrs. Bowles
suddenly, “we were almost within sight of Shonts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>(This man had been at Shonts even at the
time when Bealby was there!)</p>

<p class='c011'>“Early on Sunday morning. Told to go. I
was fairly flabbergasted. What the deuce is a
man to do? Where’s he to go? Sunday? One
doesn’t go to places, Sunday morning. There
I’d been sleeping like a lamb all night and suddenly
in came Laxton and said, ‘Look here, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>know,’ he said, ‘you’ve got to oblige me and pack
your bag and go. Now.’ ‘Why?’ said I. ‘Because
you’ve driven the Lord Chancellor stark
staring mad!’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But how?” asked the Professor, almost angrily,
“how? I don’t see it. Why should he
ask you to go?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>I</em> don’t know!” cried Captain Douglas.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but—!” said the Professor, protesting
against the unreasonableness of mankind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d had a word or two with him in the train.
Nothing to speak of. About occupying two
corner seats—always strikes me as a cad’s
trick—but on my honour I didn’t rub it in. And
then he got it into his head we were laughing at
him at dinner—we were a bit, but only the sort
of thing one says about anyone—way he works
his eyebrows and all that—and then he thought
I was ragging him.... I <em>don’t</em> rag people. Got
it so strongly he made a row that night. Said
I’d made a ghost slap him on his back. Hang
it!—what <em>can</em> you say to a thing like that? In
my room all the time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You suffer for the sins of your brother,”
said Mrs. Bowles.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Heavens!” cried the captain, “I never thought
of that! Perhaps he mistook me....”</p>

<p class='c011'>He reflected for a moment and continued his
narrative. “Then in the night, you know, he
heard noises.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They always do,” said the Professor nodding
confirmation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Couldn’t sleep.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“A sure sign,” said the Professor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And finally he sallied out in the early morning,
caught the butler in one of the secret passages—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How did the butler get into the secret passage?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Going round, I suppose. Part of his duties....
Anyhow he gave the poor beggar an awful
doing—awful—<em>brutal</em>—black eye,—all that
sort of thing; man much too respectful to hit
back. Finally declared I’d been getting up a
kind of rag,—squaring the servants to help and
so forth.... Laxton, I fancy, half believed
it.... Awkward thing, you know, having it
said about that you ragged the Lord Chancellor.
Makes a man seem a sort of mischievous idiot.
Injures a man. Then going away, you see,
seems a kind of admission....”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why did you go?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lucy,” said the captain compactly. “Hysterics.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shonts would have burst,” he added, “if I
hadn’t gone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Madeleine was helpful. “But you’ll have to
do <em>something</em> further,” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is one to <em>do</em>?” squealed the captain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The sooner you get the Lord Chancellor
certified a lunatic,” said the Professor soundly,
“the better for your professional prospects.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He went on pretty bad after I’d gone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ve heard”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Two letters. I picked ’em up at Wheatley
Post Office this morning. You know he hadn’t
done with that butler. Actually got out of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>place and scruffed the poor devil at lunch. Shook
him like a rat, she says. Said the man wasn’t
giving him anything to drink—nice story, eh?
Anyhow he scruffed him until things got broken....</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had it all from Minnie Timbre—you
know, used to be Minnie Flax.” He shot a propitiating
glance at Madeleine. “Used to be
neighbours of ours, you know, in the old time.
Half the people, she says, didn’t know what was
happening. Thought the butler was apoplectic
and that old Moggeridge was helping him stand
up. Taking off his collar. It was Laxton thought
of saying it was a fit. Told everybody, she says.
Had to tell ’em Something, I suppose. But she
saw better and she thinks a good many others
did. Laxton ran ’em both out of the room.
Nice scene for Shonts, eh? Thundering awkward
for poor Lucy. Not the sort of thing the county
expected. Has her both ways. Can’t go to a
house where the Lord Chancellor goes mad. One
alternative. Can’t go to a house where the
butler has fits. That’s the other. See the dilemma?...”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve got a letter from Lucy, too. It’s here”—he
struggled—“See? Eight sheets—pencil.
No Joke for a man to read that. And she writes
worse than any decent self-respecting illiterate
woman has a right to do. Quivers. Like writing
in a train. Can’t read half of it. But <em>she’s</em> got
something about a boy on her mind. Mad about
a boy. Have I taken away a boy? They’ve lost
a boy. Took him in my luggage, I suppose.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>She’d better write to the Lord Chancellor. Likely
as not he met him in some odd corner and flew at
him. Smashed him to atoms. Dispersed him.
Anyhow they’ve lost a boy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He protested to the world. “<em>I</em> can’t go hunting
lost boys for Lucy. I’ve done enough coming
away as I did....”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Bowles held out an arresting cigarette.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What sort of boy was lost?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>I</em> don’t know. Some little beast of a boy.
I daresay she’d only imagined it. Whole thing
been too much for her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Read that over again,” said Mrs. Bowles,
“about losing a boy. We’ve found one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That <em>little</em> chap?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We found that boy”—she glanced over her
shoulder, but Bealby was nowhere to be seen—“on
Sunday morning near Shonts. He strayed
into us like a lost kitten.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I thought you said you knew his father,
Judy,” objected the Professor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Didn’t verify,” said Mrs. Bowles shortly, and
then to Captain Douglas, “read over again what
Lady Laxton says about him....”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 6</h3>

<p class='c010'>Captain Douglas struggled with the difficulties
of his cousin’s handwriting.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everybody drew together over the fragments
of the dessert with an eager curiosity, and
helped to weigh Lady Laxton’s rather dishevelled
phrases....</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>
  <div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 7</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“We’ll call the principal witness,” said Mrs.
Bowles at last, warming to the business. “Dick!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Di-ick!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Dick!</em>”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Professor got up and strolled round behind
the caravan. Then he returned. “No boy there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He <em>heard</em>!” said Mrs. Bowles in a large whisper
and making round wonder-eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She <em>says</em>,” said Douglas, “that the chances
are he’s got into the secret passages....”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Professor strolled out to the road and
looked up it and then down upon the roofs of
Winthorpe-Sutbury. “No,” he said. “He’s mizzled.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’s only gone away for a bit,” said Mrs.
Geedge. “He does sometimes after lunch. He’ll
come back to wash up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’s probably taking a snooze among the yew
bushes before facing the labours of washing
up,” said Mrs. Bowles. “He <em>can’t</em> have mizzled.
You see — in there — He can’t by any chance
have taken his luggage!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She got up and clambered—with a little
difficulty because of its piled-up position, into the
caravan. “It’s all right,” she called out of the
door. “His little parsivel is still here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her head disappeared again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t think he’d go away like this,” said
Madeleine. “After all, what is there for him to
go to—even if he is Lady Laxton’s missing
boy....”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“I don’t believe he heard a word of it,” said
Mrs. Geedge....</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Bowles reappeared, with a curious-looking
brown paper parcel in her hand. She descended
carefully. She sat down by the fire and held the
parcel on her knees. She regarded it and her
companions waggishly and lit a fresh cigarette.
“Our link with Dick,” she said, with the cigarette
in her mouth.</p>

<p class='c011'>She felt the parcel, she poised the parcel, she
looked at it more and more waggishly. “I
<em>wonder</em>,” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her expression became so waggish that her
husband knew she was committed to behaviour
of the utmost ungentlemanliness. He had long
ceased to attempt restraint in these moods. She
put her head on one side and tore open the corner
of the parcel just a little way.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A tin can,” she said in a stage whisper.</p>

<p class='c011'>She enlarged the opening. “Blades of grass,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Professor tried to regard it humorously.
“Even if you have ceased to be decent you can
still be frank.... I think, now, my dear,
you might just straightforwardly undo the
parcel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She did. Twelve unsympathetic eyes surveyed
the evidences of Bealby’s utter poverty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’s coming,” cried Madeleine suddenly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Judy repacked hastily, but it was a false alarm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I said he’d mizzled,” said the Professor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And without washing up!” wailed Madeleine,
“I couldn’t have thought it of him....”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>
  <div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 8</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>But Bealby had not “mizzled,” although he
was conspicuously not in evidence about the
camp. There was neither sight nor sound of
him for all the time they sat about the vestiges
of their meal. They talked of him and of topics
arising out of him, and whether the captain
should telegraph to Lady Laxton, “Boy practically
found.” “I’d rather just find him,” said
the captain, “and anyhow until we get hold of
him we don’t know it’s her particular boy.”
Then they talked of washing-up and how detestable
it was. And suddenly the two husbands,
seeing their advantage, renewed their proposals
that the caravanners should put up at the golflinks
hotel, and have baths and the comforts
of civilization for a night or so—and anyhow
walk thither for tea. And as William had now
returned—he was sitting on the turf afar off
smoking a nasty-looking short clay pipe—they
rose up and departed. But Captain Douglas
and Miss Philips for some reason did not go off
exactly with the others, but strayed apart, straying
away more and more into a kind of solitude....</p>

<p class='c011'>First the four married people and then the
two lovers disappeared over the crest of the
downs....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 9</h3>

<p class='c010'>For a time, except for its distant sentinel, the
caravan seemed absolutely deserted, and then a
clump of bramble against the wall of the old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>chalk pit became agitated and a small rueful
disillusioned white-smeared little Bealby crept
back into the visible universe again. His heart
was very heavy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The time had come to go.</p>

<p class='c011'>And he did not want to go. He had loved the
caravan. He had adored Madeleine.</p>

<p class='c011'>He would go, but he would go beautifully—touchingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>He would wash up before he went, he would
make everything tidy, he would leave behind him
a sense of irreparable loss....</p>

<p class='c011'>With a mournful precision he set about this
undertaking. If Mergleson could have seen,
Mergleson would have been amazed....</p>

<p class='c011'>He made everything look wonderfully tidy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then in the place where she had sat, lying on
her rug, he found her favourite book, a small
volume of Swinburne’s poems very beautifully
bound. Captain Douglas had given it to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby handled it with a kind of reverence.
So luxurious it was, so unlike the books in Bealby’s
world, so altogether of her quality.... Strange
forces prompted him. For a time he hesitated.
Then decision came with a rush. He selected a
page, drew the stump of a pencil from his pocket,
wetted it very wet and, breathing hard, began to
write that traditional message, “Farewell. Remember
Art Bealby.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To this he made an original addition: “I
washt up before I went.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he remembered that so far as this caravan
went he was not Art Bealby at all. He renewed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>the wetness of his pencil and drew black lines
athwart the name of “Art Bealby” until it was
quite unreadable; then across this again and
pressing still deeper so that the subsequent
pages re-echoed it he wrote these singular words
“Ed rightful Earl Shonts.” Then he was
ashamed, and largely obliterated this by still
more forcible strokes. Finally above it all plainly
and nakedly he wrote “Dick Mal-travers....”</p>

<p class='c011'>He put down the book with a sigh and stood
up.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everything was beautifully in order. But
could he not do something yet? There came
to him the idea of wreathing the entire camping
place with boughs of yew. It would look lovely—and
significant. He set to work. At first he
toiled zealously, but yew is tough to get and
soon his hands were painful. He cast about for
some easier way, and saw beneath the hind
wheels of the caravan great green boughs—one
particularly a splendid long branch.... It
seemed to him that it would be possible to withdraw
this branch from the great heap of sticks
and stones that stayed up the hind wheels of
the caravan. It seemed to him that that was
so. He was mistaken, but that was his idea.</p>

<p class='c011'>He set to work to do it. It was rather more
difficult to manage than he had supposed; there
were unexpected ramifications, wider resistances.
Indeed, the thing seemed rooted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby was a resolute youngster at bottom.</p>

<p class='c011'>He warmed to his task.... He tugged
harder and harder....</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>
  <div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 10</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>How various is the quality of humanity!</p>

<p class='c011'>About Bealby there was ever an imaginative
touch; he was capable of romance, of gallantries,
of devotion. William was of a grosser clay,
slave of his appetites, a materialist. Such men
as William drive one to believe in born inferiors,
in the existence of a lower sort, in the natural
inequality of men.</p>

<p class='c011'>While Bealby was busy at his little gentle task
of reparation, a task foolish perhaps and not too
ably conceived, but at any rate morally gracious,
William had no thought in the world but the
satisfaction of those appetites that the consensus
of all mankind has definitely relegated to the
lower category. And which Heaven has relegated
to the lower regions of our frame. He
came now slinking towards the vestiges of the
caravanners’ picnic, and no one skilled in the
interpretation of the human physiognomy could
have failed to read the significance of the tongue
tip that drifted over his thin oblique lips. He
came so softly towards the encampment that
Bealby did not note him. Partly William thought
of remnants of food, but chiefly he was intent to
drain the bottles. Bealby had stuck them all
neatly in a row a little way up the hill. There
was a cider bottle with some heel-taps of cider,
William drank that; then there was nearly half a
bottle of hock and William drank that, then
there were the drainings of the Burgundy and
Apollinaris. It was all drink to William.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>And after he had drained each bottle William
winked at the watching angels and licked his lips,
and patted the lower centres of his being with a
shameless base approval. Then fired by alcohol,
robbed of his last vestiges of self-control, his
thoughts turned to the delicious chocolates that
were stored in a daintily beribboned box in the
little drawers beneath the sleeping bunk of Miss
Philips. There was a new brightness in his eye,
a spot of pink in either cheek. With an expression
of the lowest cunning he reconnoitred Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby was busy about something at the back
end of the caravan, tugging at something.</p>

<p class='c011'>With swift stealthy movements of an entirely
graceless sort, William got up into the front of
the caravan.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just for a moment he hesitated before going in.
He craned his neck to look round the side at the
unconscious Bealby, wrinkled the vast nose into
an unpleasant grimace and then—a crouching
figure of appetite—he crept inside.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here they were! He laid his hand in the
drawer, halted listening....</p>

<p class='c011'>What was that?...</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly the caravan swayed. He stumbled,
and fear crept into his craven soul. The caravan
lurched. It was moving.... Its hind wheels
came to the ground with a crash....</p>

<p class='c011'>He took a step doorward and was pitched sideways
and thrown upon his knees.... Then he
was hurled against the dresser and hit by a falling
plate. A cup fell and smashed and the caravan
seemed to leap and bound....</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Through the little window he had a glimpse of
yew bushes hurrying upward. The caravan was
going down hill....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lummy!” said William, clutching at the
bunks to hold himself upright....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ca-arnt be that drink!” said William, aspread
and aghast....</p>

<p class='c011'>He attempted the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Crikey! Here! Hold in! My shin!” ...
“’Tis thut Brasted Vool of a Boy!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“....” said William. “....——....</p>

<div  class='figleft id001'>
<img src='images/i_124.jpg' alt='—— —— ——.” “——.”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 11</h3>

<p class='c010'>The caravan party soon came to its decision.
They would stay the night in the hotel. And so as
soon as they had had some tea they decided to go
back and make William bring the caravan and all
the ladies’ things round to the hotel. With characteristic
eagerness, Professor Bowles led the way.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so it was Professor Bowles who first saw
the release of the caravan. He barked. One
short sharp bark. “Whup!” he cried, and very
quickly, “Whatstheboydoing?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Then quite a different style of noise, with the
mouth open “Wha—hoop!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he set off running very fast down towards
the caravan, waving his arms and shouting as
he ran, “Yaaps! You <em>Idiot</em>. Yaaps!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The others were less promptly active.</p>

<p class='c011'>Down the slope they saw Bealby, a little
struggling active Bealby, tugging away at a yew
branch until the caravan swayed with his efforts,
and then—then there was a movement as though
the thing tossed its head and reared, and a smash
as the heap of stuff that stayed up its hind wheels
collapsed....</p>

<p class='c011'>It plunged like a horse with a dog at its heels,
it lurched sideways, and then with an air of quiet
deliberation started down the grass slope to the
road and Winthorpe-Sutbury....</p>

<p class='c011'>Professor Bowles sped in pursuit like the wind,
and Mrs. Bowles after a gasping moment set off
after her lord, her face round and resolute. Mr.
Geedge followed at a more dignified pace, making
the only really sound suggestion that was offered
on the occasion. “Hue! Stop it!” cried Mr.
Geedge, for all the world like his great prototype
at the Balkan Conference. And then like a large
languid pair of scissors he began to run. Mrs.
Geedge after some indefinite moments decided
to see the humour of it all, and followed after her
lord, in a fluttering rush, emitting careful little
musical giggles as she ran, giggles that she had
learnt long ago from a beloved schoolfellow.
Captain Douglas and Miss Philips were some way
behind the others, and the situation had already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>developed considerably before they grasped what
was happening. Then obeying the instincts of a
soldier the captain came charging to support the
others, and Miss Madeleine Philips after some
wasted gestures realized that nobody was looking
at her, and sat down quietly on the turf until
this paralyzing state of affairs should cease.</p>

<p class='c011'>The caravan remained the centre of interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Without either indecent haste or any complete
pause it pursued its way down the road towards the
tranquil village below. Except for the rumbling of
its wheels and an occasional concussion it made
very little sound: once or twice there was a faint
sound of breaking crockery from its interior and
once the phantom of an angry yell, but that was all.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was an effect of discovered personality
about the thing. This vehicle, which had hitherto
been content to play a background part, a yellow
patch amidst the scenery, was now revealing an
individuality. It was purposeful and touched
with a suggestion of playfulness, at once kindly
and human; it had its thoughtful instants, its
phases of quick decision, yet never once did it
altogether lose a certain mellow dignity. There
was nothing servile about it; never for a moment,
for example, did it betray its blind obedience to
gravitation. It was rather as if it and gravitation
were going hand in hand. It came out into the
road, butted into the bank, swept round, meditated
for a full second, and then shafts foremost
headed downhill, going quietly faster and faster
and swaying from bank to bank. The shafts
went before it like arms held out....</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>It had a quality—as if it were a favourite
elephant running to a beloved master from whom
it had been over-long separated. Or a slightly
intoxicated and altogether happy yellow guinea-pig
making for some coveted food....</p>

<p class='c011'>At a considerable distance followed Professor
Bowles, a miracle of compact energy, running
so fast that he seemed only to touch the ground
at very rare intervals....</p>

<p class='c011'>And then, dispersedly, in their order and
according to their natures, the others....</p>

<p class='c011'>There was fortunately very little on the road.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a perambulator containing twins,
whose little girl guardian was so fortunate as to
be high up on the bank gathering blackberries.</p>

<p class='c011'>A ditcher, ditching.</p>

<p class='c011'>A hawker lost in thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>His cart, drawn by a poor little black screw of
a pony and loaded with the cheap flawed crockery
that is so popular among the poor.</p>

<p class='c011'>A dog asleep in the middle of the village street....
Amidst this choice of objects the caravan
displayed a whimsical humanity. It reduced
the children in the perambulator to tears, but
passed. It might have reduced them to a sort
of red-currant jelly. It lurched heavily towards
the ditcher and spared him, it chased the hawker
up the bank, it whipped off a wheel from the cart
of crockery (which after an interval of astonishment
fell like a vast objurgation) and then it
directed its course with a grim intentness towards
the dog.</p>

<p class='c011'>It just missed the dog.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>He woke up not a moment too soon. He fled
with a yelp of dismay.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then the caravan careered on a dozen
yards further, lost energy and—the only really
undignified thing in its whole career—stood on
its head in a wide wet ditch. It did this with
just the slightest lapse into emphasis. <em>There!</em>
It was as if it gave a grunt—and perhaps there
was the faintest suggestion of William in that
grunt—and then it became quite still....</p>

<p class='c011'>For a time the caravan seemed finished and
done. Its steps hung from its upper end like the
tongue of a tired dog. Except for a few minute
noises as though it was scratching itself inside, it
was as inanimate as death itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>But up the hill road the twins were weeping,
the hawker and the ditcher were saying raucous
things, the hawker’s pony had backed into the
ditch and was taking ill-advised steps, for which
it was afterwards to be sorry, amidst his stock-in-trade,
and Professor Bowles, Mrs. Bowles,
Mr. Geedge, Captain Douglas and Mrs. Geedge
were running—running—one heard the various
patter of their feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then came signs of life at the upward door
of the caravan, a hand, an arm, an active investigating
leg seeking a hold, a large nose, a small
intent vicious eye; in fact—William.</p>

<p class='c011'>William maddened.</p>

<p class='c011'>Professor Bowles had reached the caravan.
With a startling agility he clambered up by the
wheels and step and confronted the unfortunate
driver. It was an occasion for mutual sympathy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>rather than anger, but the Professor was hasty,
efficient and unsympathetic with the lower classes,
and William’s was an ill-regulated temperament.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You consummate <em>ass</em>!” began Professor
Bowles....</p>

<p class='c011'>When William heard Professor Bowles say
this, incontinently he smote him in the face, and
when Professor Bowles was smitten in the face
he grappled instantly and very bravely and
resolutely with William.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment they struggled fearfully, they
seemed to be endowed instantaneously with
innumerable legs, and then suddenly they fell
through the door of the caravan into the interior,
their limbs seemed to whirl for a wonderful
instant and then they were swallowed up....</p>

<p class='c011'>The smash was tremendous. You would not
have thought there was nearly so much in the
caravan still left to get broken....</p>

<p class='c011'>A healing silence....</p>

<p class='c011'>At length smothered noises of still inadequate
adjustment within....</p>

<p class='c011'>The village population in a state of scared delight
appeared at a score of points and converged
upon the catastrophe. Sounds of renewed
dissension between William and the Professor inside
the rearing yellow bulk, promised further interests
and added an element of mystery to this
manifest disaster.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>§ 12</h3>

<p class='c010'>As Bealby, still grasping his great branch of
yew, watched these events, a sense of human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>futility invaded his youthful mind. For the first
time he realized the gulf between intention and
result. He had meant so well....</p>

<p class='c011'>He perceived it would be impossible to explain....</p>

<p class='c011'>The thought of even attempting to explain
things to Professor Bowles was repellent to
him....</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked about him with round despairful
eyes. He selected a direction which seemed to
promise the maximum of concealment with the
minimum of conversational possibility, and in
that direction and without needless delay he
set off, eager to turn over an entirely fresh page
in his destiny as soon as possible....</p>

<p class='c011'>To get away, the idea possessed all his being.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the crest of the downs a sweet voice
floated after his retreating form and never overtook
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Di-ick!”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 13</h3>

<p class='c010'>Then presently Miss Philips arose to her feet,
gathered her skirts in her hand and with her
delicious chin raised and an expression of countenance
that was almost businesslike, descended
towards the gathering audience below. She wore
wide-flowing skirts and came down the hill in
Artemesian strides.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was high time that somebody looked at her.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'>THE SEEKING OF BEALBY</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 1</h3>

<p class='c010'>On the same Monday evening that witnessed
Bealby’s first experience of the theatre, Mr.
Mergleson, the house steward of Shonts, walked
slowly and thoughtfully across the corner of the
park between the laundry and the gardens. His
face was much recovered from the accidents of
his collision with the Lord Chancellor, resort to
raw meat in the kitchen had checked the development
of his injuries, and only a few contusions
in the side of his face were more than
faintly traceable. And suffering had on the
whole rather ennobled than depressed his bearing.
He had a black eye, but it was not, he felt, a common
black eye. It came from high quarters
and through no fault of Mr. Mergleson’s own.
He carried it well. It was a fruit of duty rather
than the outcome of wanton pleasure-seeking or
misdirected passion.</p>

<p class='c011'>He found Mr. Darling in profound meditation
over some peach trees against the wall. They
were not doing so well as they ought to do and Mr.
Darling was engaged in wondering why.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good evening, Mr. Darling,” said Mr. Mergleson.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Mr. Darling ceased rather slowly to wonder
and turned to his friend. “Good evening, Mr.
Mergleson,” he said. “I don’t quite like the
look of these here peaches, <em>blowed</em> if I do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Mergleson glanced at the peaches, and then
came to the matter that was nearest his heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You ’aven’t I suppose seen anything of your
stepson these last two days, Mr. Darling?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Naturally <em>not</em>,” said Mr. Darling, putting
his head on one side and regarding his interlocutor.
“Naturally not,—I’ve left that to
you, Mr. Mergleson.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, that’s what’s awkward,” said Mr.
Mergleson, and then, with a forced easiness, “You
see, I ain’t seen ’im either.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No. I lost sight of ’im—” Mr. Mergleson
appeared to reflect—“late on Sattiday night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Ow’s that, Mr. Mergleson?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Mergleson considered the difficulties of
lucid explanation. “We missed ’im,” said Mr.
Mergleson simply, regarding the well-weeded
garden path with a calculating expression and then
lifting his eyes to Mr. Darling’s with an air of
great candour. “And we continue to miss him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Well!</em>” said Mr. Darling. “That’s rum.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Mr. Mergleson.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s decidedly rum,” said Mr. Darling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We thought ’e might be ’iding from ’is work.
Or cut off ’ome.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You didn’t send down to ask.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We was too busy with the week-end people.
On the ’ole we thought if ’e <em>’ad</em> cut ’ome, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>’ole, ’e wasn’t a very serious loss. ’E got in
the way at times.... And there was one or
two things ’appened—... Now that they’re all
gone and ’e ’asn’t turned up—Well, I came
down, Mr. Darling, to arst you. Where’s ’e
gone?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’E ain’t come ’ere,” said Mr. Darling surveying
the garden.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I ’arf expected ’e might and I ’arf expected
’e mightn’t,” said Mr. Mergleson with the air
of one who had anticipated Mr. Darling’s answer
but hesitated to admit as much.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two gentlemen paused for some seconds
and regarded each other searchingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where’s ’e <em>got</em> to?” said Mr. Darling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” said Mr. Mergleson, putting his hands
where the tails of his short jacket would have
been if it hadn’t been short, and looking extraordinarily
like a parrot in its more thoughtful
moods, “to tell you the truth, Mr. Darling,
I’ve ’ad a dream about ’im—and it worries me.
I got a sort of ideer of ’im as being in one of them
secret passages. ’Iding away. There was a
guest, well, I say it with all respec’ but <em>anyone</em>
might ’ave ’id from ’im.... S’morning soon
as the week-end ’ad cleared up and gone ’ome,
me and Thomas went through them passages as
well as we could. Not a trace of ’im. But I still
got that ideer. ’E was a wriggling, climbing,—enterprising
sort of boy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve checked ’im for it once or twice,” said
Mr. Darling with the red light of fierce memories
gleaming for a moment in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“’E might even,” said Mr. Mergleson, “well,
very likely ’ave got ’imself jammed in one of
them secret passages....”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jammed,” repeated Mr. Darling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well—got ’imself somewhere where ’e can’t
get out. I’ve ’eard tell there’s walled-up dungeons.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They say,” said Mr. Darling, “there’s underground
passages to the Abbey ruins—three good
mile away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Orkward,” said Mr. Mergleson....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drat ’is eyes!” said Mr. Darling, scratching
his head. “What does ’e mean by it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We can’t leave ’im there,” said Mr. Mergleson.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I knowed a young devil once what crawled
up a culvert,” said Mr. Darling. “’Is father
’ad to dig ’im out like a fox.... Lord! ’ow ’e
walloped ’im for it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mistake to ’ave a boy in so young,” said Mr.
Mergleson.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s all very awkward,” said Mr. Darling,
surveying every aspect of the case. “You see—.
’Is mother sets a most estrordinary value on
’im. Most estrordinary.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know whether she oughtn’t to be told,”
said Mr. Mergleson. “I was thinking of that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Darling was not the sort of man to meet
trouble half-way. He shook his head at that.
“Not yet, Mr. Mergleson. I don’t think yet.
Not until everything’s been tried. I don’t think
there’s any need to give her needless distress,—none
whatever. If you don’t mind I think I’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>come up to-night—nineish say—and ’ave a
talk to you and Thomas about it—a quiet
talk. Best to begin with a <em>quiet</em> talk. It’s a
dashed rum go, and me and you we got to think
it out a bit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s what <em>I</em> think,” said Mr. Mergleson
with unconcealed relief at Mr. Darling’s friendliness.
“That’s exactly the light, Mr. Darling,
in which it appears to me. Because, you see—if
’e’s all right and in the ’ouse, why doesn’t
’e come for ’is vittels?”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 2</h3>

<p class='c010'>In the pantry that evening the question of telling
someone was discussed further. It was discussed
over a number of glasses of Mr. Mergleson’s
beer. For, following a sound tradition, Mr.
Mergleson brewed at Shonts, and sometimes
he brewed well and sometimes he brewed ill, and
sometimes he brewed weak and sometimes he
brewed strong, and there was no monotony in the
cups at Shonts. This was sturdy stuff and suited
Mr. Darling’s mood, and ever and again with an
author’s natural weakness and an affectation of
abstraction Mr. Mergleson took the jug out
empty and brought it back foaming.</p>

<p class='c011'>Henry, the second footman, was disposed to a
forced hopefulness so as not to spoil the evening,
but Thomas was sympathetic and distressed.
The red-haired youth made cigarettes with a little
machine, licked them and offered them to the
others, saying little, as became him. Etiquette
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>deprived him of an uninvited beer, and Mr.
Mergleson’s inattention completed what etiquette
began.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t bear to think of the poor little beggar,
stuck head foremost into some cobwebby cranny,
blowed if I can,” said Thomas, getting help from
the jug.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was an interesting kid,” said Thomas in a
tone that was frankly obituary. “He didn’t
like his work, one could see that, but he was
lively—and I tried to help him along all I could,
when I wasn’t too busy myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was something sensitive about him,”
said Thomas.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Mergleson sat with his arms loosely thrown
out over the table.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What we got to do is to tell someone,” he
said, “I don’t see ’ow I can put off telling ’er
ladyship—after to-morrow morning. And then—’eaven
’elp us!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Course <em>I</em> got to tell <em>my</em> missis,” said Mr.
Darling, and poured in a preoccupied way, some
running over.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’ll go through them passages again now
before we go to bed,” said Mr. Mergleson, “far
as we can. But there’s ’oles and chinks on’y
a boy could get through.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>I</em> got to tell the missis,” said Mr. Darling.
“That’s what’s worrying me....”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the evening wore on there was a tendency on
the part of Mr. Darling to make this the refrain
of his discourse. He sought advice. “’Ow’d
you tell the missis?” he asked Mr. Mergleson,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>and emptied a glass to control his impatience
before Mr. Mergleson replied.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall tell ’er ladyship, just simply, the fact.
I shall say, your ladyship, here’s my boy gone
and we don’t know where. And as she arsts me
questions so shall I give particulars.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Darling reflected and then shook his head
slowly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Ow’d <em>ju</em> tell the missis?” he asked Thomas.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Glad I haven’t got to,” said Thomas. “<em>Poor</em>
little beggar.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but ’ow <em>would</em> you tell ’er?” Mr. Darling
said, varying the accent very carefully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d go to ’er and I’d pat her back and I’d say,
‘bear up,’ see, and when she asked what for, I’d
just tell her what for—gradual like.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You don’t know the missis,” said Mr. Darling.
“Henry, ’ow’d <em>ju</em> tell ’er?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let ’er find out,” said Henry. “Wimmin
do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Darling reflected, and decided that too was
unworkable.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Ow’d <em>you</em>?” he asked with an air of desperation
of the red-haired youth.</p>

<p class='c011'>The red-haired youth remained for a moment
with his tongue extended, licking the gum of a
cigarette paper, and his eyes on Mr. Darling.
Then he finished the cigarette slowly, giving his
mind very carefully to the question he had been
honoured with. “I think,” he said, in a low
serious voice, “I should say, just simply, Mary—or
Susan—or whatever her name is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tilda,” supplied Mr. Darling.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“‘Tilda,’ I should say. ‘The Lord gave and
the Lord ’ath taken away. Tilda!—’e’s gone.’
Somethin’ like that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The red-haired boy cleared his throat. He was
rather touched by his own simple eloquence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Darling reflected on this with profound
satisfaction for some moments. Then he broke
out almost querulously, “Yes, but brast him!—<em>where’s</em>
’e gone?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anyhow,” said Mr. Darling, “I ain’t going
to tell ’er, not till the morning. I ain’t going to
lose my night’s rest if I <em>have</em> lost my stepson.
Nohow. Mr. Mergleson, I <em>must</em> say, I don’t
think I ever <em>’ave</em> tasted better beer. Never.
It’s—it’s famous beer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had some more....</p>

<p class='c011'>On his way back through the moonlight to the
gardens Mr. Darling was still unsettled as to the
exact way of breaking things to his wife. He had
come out from the house a little ruffled because
of Mr. Mergleson’s opposition to a rather good
idea of his that he should go about the house
and “holler for ’im a bit. He’d know my voice,
you see. Ladyship wouldn’t mind. Very likely
’sleep by now.” But the moonlight dispelled
his irritation.</p>

<p class='c011'>How was he to tell his wife? He tried various
methods to the listening moon.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was for example the off-hand newsy way.
“You know tha’ boy yours?” Then a pause for
the reply. Then, “’E’s toley dis’peared.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Only there are difficulties about the word
totally.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Or the distressed impersonal manner. “Dre’fle
thing happen’d. Dre’fle thing. Tha’ poo’ lill’
chap, Artie—toley dis’peared.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Totally again.</p>

<p class='c011'>Or the personal intimate note. “Dunno wha’
you’ll say t’me, Tilda, when you hear what-togottasay.
Thur’ly bad news. Seems they los’
our Artie up there—clean los’ ’im. Can’t fine
’im nowhere tall.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Or the authoritative kindly. “Tilda—you
go’ control yourself. Go’ show whad you made
of. Our boy—’e’s—hic—<em>los’</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he addressed the park at large with a
sudden despair. “Don’ care wha’ I say, she’ll
blame it on to me. I <em>know</em> ’er!”</p>

<p class='c011'>After that the enormous pathos of the situation
got hold of him. “Poor lill’ chap,” he said.
“Poor lill’ fell’,” and shed a few natural tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Loved ’im jessis mione son.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the circumambient night made no reply he
repeated the remark in a louder, almost domineering
tone....</p>

<p class='c011'>He spent some time trying to climb the garden
wall because the door did not seem to be in the
usual place. (Have to enquire about that in the
morning. Difficult to see everything is all right
when one is so bereaved). But finally he came on
the door round a corner.</p>

<p class='c011'>He told his wife merely that he intended to
have a peaceful night, and took off his boots in
a defiant and intermittent manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>The morning would be soon enough.</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked at him pretty hard, and he looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>at her ever and again, but she never made a
guess at it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bed.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 3</h3>

<p class='c010'>So soon as the week-enders had dispersed and
Sir Peter had gone off to London to attend to
various matters affecting the peptonizing of milk
and the distribution of baby soothers about the
habitable globe, Lady Laxton went back to bed
and remained in bed until midday on Tuesday.
Nothing short of complete rest and the utmost
kindness from her maid would, she felt, save her
from a nervous breakdown of the most serious
description. The festival had been stormy to
the end. Sir Peter’s ill-advised attempts to
deprive Lord Moggeridge of alcohol had led to a
painful struggle at lunch, and this had been
followed by a still more unpleasant scene between
host and guest in the afternoon. “This is an
occasion for tact,” Sir Peter had said and had
gone off to tackle the Lord Chancellor, leaving
his wife to the direst, best founded apprehensions.
For Sir Peter’s tact was a thing by itself, a mixture
of misconception, recrimination and familiarity
that was rarely well received....</p>

<p class='c011'>She had had to explain to the Sunday dinner
party that his lordship had been called away
suddenly. “Something connected with the Great
Seal,” Lady Laxton had whispered in a discreet
mysterious whisper. One or two simple hearers
were left with the persuasion that the Great Seal
had been taken suddenly unwell—and probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>in a slightly indelicate manner. Thomas had to
paint Mergleson’s eye with grease-paint left over
from some private theatricals. It had been a
patched-up affair altogether, and before she retired
to bed that night Lady Laxton had given way
to her accumulated tensions and wept.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no reason whatever why to wind up
the day Sir Peter should have stayed in her room
for an hour saying what he thought of Lord
Moggeridge. She felt she knew quite well
enough what he thought of Lord Moggeridge,
and on these occasions he always used a number
of words that she did her best to believe, as a
delicately brought up woman, were unfamiliar
to her ears....</p>

<p class='c011'>So on Monday, as soon as the guests had gone,
she went to bed again and stayed there, trying as
a good woman should to prevent herself thinking
of what the neighbours could be thinking—and
saying—of the whole affair, by studying a new
and very circumstantial pamphlet by Bishop Fowle
on social evils, turning over the moving illustrations
of some recent antivivisection literature
and re-reading the accounts in the morning papers
of a colliery disaster in the north of England.</p>

<p class='c011'>To such women as Lady Laxton, brought up
in an atmosphere of refinement that is almost
colourless, and living a life troubled only by small
social conflicts and the minor violence of Sir
Peter, blameless to the point of complete uneventfulness,
and secure and comfortable to the
point of tedium, there is something amounting
to fascination in the wickedness and sufferings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>of more normally situated people, there is a real
attraction and solace in the thought of pain and
stress, and as her access to any other accounts of
vice and suffering was restricted she kept herself
closely in touch with the more explicit literature
of the various movements for human moralization
that distinguish our age, and responded
eagerly and generously to such painful catastrophes
as enliven it. The counterfoils of her
cheque book witnessed to her gratitude for these
vicarious sensations. She figured herself to
herself in her day dreams as a calm and white
and shining intervention checking and reproving
amusements of an undesirable nature, and earning
the tearful blessings of the mangled by-products
of industrial enterprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a curious craving for entire reality
in the feminine composition, and there were times
when in spite of these feasts of particulars, she
wished she could come just a little nearer to the
heady dreadfulnesses of life than simply writing
a cheque against it. She would have liked to
have actually <em>seen</em> the votaries of evil blench
and repent before her contributions, to have, herself,
unstrapped and revived and pitied some
doomed and chloroformed victim of the so-called
“scientist,” to have herself participated in
the stretcher and the hospital and humanity
made marvellous by enlistment under the red-cross
badge. But Sir Peter’s ideals of womanhood
were higher than his language, and he would
not let her soil her refinement with any vision of
the pain and evil in the world. “Sort of woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>they want up there is a Trained Nurse,” he used
to say when she broached the possibility of <em>going</em>
to some famine or disaster. “<em>You</em> don’t want
to go prying, old girl....”</p>

<p class='c011'>She suffered, she felt, from repressed heroism.
If ever she was to shine in disaster that disaster,
she felt, must come to her, she might not go to
meet it, and so you realize how deeply it stirred
her, how it brightened her and uplifted her to
learn from Mr. Mergleson’s halting statements
that perhaps, that probably, that almost certainly,
a painful and tragical thing was happening
even now within the walls of Shonts, that there
was urgent necessity for action—if anguish was
to be witnessed before it had ended, and life saved.</p>

<p class='c011'>She clasped her hands; she surveyed her large
servitor with agonized green-grey eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Something must be done at once,” she said.
“Everything possible must be done. Poor little
Mite!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course, my lady, ’e <em>may</em> ’ave run away!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh no!” she cried, “he hasn’t run away.
He hasn’t run away. How can you be so <em>wicked</em>,
Mergleson. Of course he hasn’t run away. He’s
there now. And it’s too dreadful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She became suddenly very firm and masterful.
The morning’s colliery tragedy inspired her
imagination.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We must get pick-axes,” she said. “We
must organize search parties. Not a moment is
to be lost, Mergleson—not a moment.... Get
the men in off the roads. Get everyone you
can....”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>And not a moment was lost. The road men
were actually at work in Shonts before their
proper dinner-hour was over.</p>

<p class='c011'>They did quite a lot of things that afternoon.
Every passage attainable from the dining-room
opening was explored, and where these passages
gave off chinks and crannies they were opened
up with a vigour which Lady Laxton had greatly
stimulated by an encouraging presence and
liberal doses of whisky. Through their efforts a
fine new opening was made into the library
from the wall near the window, a hole big enough
for a man to fall through, because one did, and a
great piece of stonework was thrown down from
the Queen Elizabeth tower, exposing the upper
portion of the secret passage to the light of day.
Lady Laxton herself and the head housemaid
went round the panelling with a hammer and a
chisel, and called out “Are you there?” and
attempted an opening wherever it sounded hollow.
The sweep was sent for to go up the old chimneys
outside the present flues. Meanwhile Mr. Darling
had been set with several of his men to dig
for, discover, pick up and lay open the underground
passage or disused drain, whichever it was,
that was known to run from the corner of the
laundry towards the old ice-house, and that was
supposed to reach to the abbey ruins. After
some bold exploratory excavations this channel
was located and a report sent at once to Lady
Laxton.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was this and the new and alarming scar on
the Queen Elizabeth tower that brought Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Beaulieu Plummer post-haste from the estate
office up to the house. Mr. Beaulieu Plummer
was the Marquis of Cranberry’s estate agent, a
man of great natural tact, and charged among
other duties with the task of seeing that the
Laxtons did not make away with Shonts during
the period of their tenancy. He was a sound
compact little man, rarely out of extreme<a id='t145'></a> riding
breeches and gaiters, and he wore glasses, that now
glittered with astonishment as he approached
Lady Laxton and her band of spade workers.</p>

<p class='c011'>At his approach Mr. Darling attempted to
become invisible, but he was unable to do so.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lady Laxton,” Mr. Beaulieu Plummer appealed,
“may I ask—?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh Mr. Beaulieu Plummer, I’m so <em>glad</em>
you’ve come. A little boy—suffocating! I
can hardly <em>bear</em> it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Suffocating!” cried Mr. Beaulieu Plummer,
“<em>where</em>?” and was in a confused manner told.</p>

<p class='c011'>He asked a number of questions that Lady
Laxton found very tiresome. But how did she
<em>know</em> the boy was in the secret passage? Of
course she knew; was it likely she would do all
this if she didn’t know? But mightn’t he have
run away? How could he when he was in the
secret passages? But why not first scour the
countryside? By which time he would be
smothered and starved and dead!...</p>

<p class='c011'>They parted with a mutual loss of esteem, and
Mr. Beaulieu Plummer, looking very serious
indeed, ran as fast as he could straight to the
village telegraph-office. Or to be more exact,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>he walked until he thought himself out of sight
of Lady Laxton and then he took to his heels and
ran. He sat for some time in the parlour post office
spoiling telegraph forms, and composing
telegrams to Sir Peter Laxton and Lord Cranberry.</p>

<p class='c011'>He got these off at last, and then drawn by an
irresistible fascination went back to the park and
watched from afar the signs of fresh activities
on the part of Lady Laxton.</p>

<p class='c011'>He saw men coming from the direction of the
stables with large rakes. With these they dragged
the ornamental waters.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then a man with a pick-axe appeared against
the skyline and crossed the roof in the direction
of the clock tower, bound upon some unknown
but probably highly destructive mission.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he saw Lady Laxton going off to the
gardens. She was going to console Mrs. Darling
in her trouble. This she did through nearly an
hour and a half. And on the whole it seemed
well to Mr. Beaulieu Plummer that so she should
be occupied....</p>

<p class='c011'>It was striking five when a telegraph boy on a
bicycle came up from the village with a telegram
from Sir Peter Laxton.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stop all proceedings absolutely,” it said,
“until I get to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Lady Laxton’s lips tightened at the message.
She was back from much weeping with Mrs.
Darling and altogether finely strung. Here she
felt was one of those supreme occasions when a
woman must assert herself. “A matter of life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>or death,” she wired in reply, and to show herself
how completely she overrode such dictation as
this she sent Mr. Mergleson down to the village
public-house with orders to engage anyone he
could find there for an evening’s work on an
extraordinarily liberal overtime scale.</p>

<p class='c011'>After taking this step the spirit of Lady Laxton
quailed. She went and sat in her own room and
quivered. She quivered but she clenched her
delicate fist.</p>

<p class='c011'>She would go through with it, come what might,
she would go on with the excavation all night
if necessary, but at the same time she began a
little to regret that she had not taken earlier
steps to demonstrate the improbability of Bealby
having simply run away. She set to work to
repair this omission. She wrote off to the
Superintendent of Police in the neighbouring
town, to the nearest police magistrate, and then
on the off chance to various of her week-end
guests, including Captain Douglas. If it was
true that he had organized the annoyance of the
Lord Chancellor (and though she still rejected
that view she did now begin to regard it as a
permissible hypothesis), then he might also know
something about the mystery of this boy’s disappearance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Each letter she wrote she wrote with greater
fatigue and haste than its predecessor and more
illegibly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Peter arrived long after dark. He cut across
the corner of the park to save time, and fell into
one of the trenches that Mr. Darling had opened.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>This added greatly to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</span></i> with which he came
into the hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lady Laxton withstood him for five minutes
and then returned abruptly to her bedroom and
locked herself in, leaving the control of the operations
in his hands....</p>

<p class='c011'>“If he’s not in the house,” said Sir Peter, “all
this is thunderin’ foolery, and if he’s in the house
he’s dead. If he’s dead he’ll smell in a bit and
then’ll be the time to look for him. Somethin’
to go upon instead of all this blind hacking
the place about. No wonder they’re threatenin’
proceedings....”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 4</h3>

<p class='c010'>Upon Captain Douglas Lady Laxton’s letter
was destined to have a very distracting effect.
Because, as he came to think it over, as he came to
put her partly illegible allusions to secret passages
and a missing boy side by side with his memories
of Lord Moggeridge’s accusations and the general
mystery of his expulsion from Shonts, it became
more and more evident to him that he had here
something remarkably like a clue, something that
might serve to lift the black suspicion of irreverence
and levity from his military reputation.
And he had already got to the point of suggesting
to Miss Philips that he ought to follow up and
secure Bealby forthwith, before ever they came
over the hill crest to witness the disaster to the
caravan.</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Douglas, it must be understood, was
a young man at war within himself.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>He had been very nicely brought up, firstly
in a charming English home, then in a preparatory
school for selected young gentlemen, then in a
good set at Eton, then at Sandhurst, where the
internal trouble had begun to manifest itself.
Afterwards the Bistershires.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were three main strands in the composition
of Captain Douglas. In the first place, and
what was peculiarly his own quality, was the
keenest interest in the <em>why</em> of things and the <em>how</em>
of things and the general mechanism of things.
He was fond of clocks, curious about engines,
eager for science; he had a quick brain and
nimble hands. He read Jules Verne and liked
to think about going to the stars and making flying
machines and submarines—in those days
when everybody knew quite certainly that such
things were impossible. His brain teemed with
larval ideas that only needed air and light to
become active full-fledged ideas. There he excelled
most of us. In the next place, but this
second strand was just a strand that most young
men have, he had a natural keen interest in the
other half of humanity, he thought them lovely,
interesting, wonderful, and they filled him with
warm curiosities and set his imagination cutting
the prettiest capers. And in the third place, and
there again he was ordinarily human, he wanted
to be liked, admired, approved, well thought of....
And so constituted he had passed through
the educational influence of that English home,
that preparatory school, the good set at Eton, the
Sandhurst discipline, the Bistershire mess....</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Now the educational influence of the English
home, the preparatory school, the good set at
Eton and Sandhurst in those days—though
Sandhurst has altered a little since—was all to
develop that third chief strand of his being to
the complete suppression of the others, to make
him look well and unobtrusive, dress well and
unobtrusively, behave well and unobtrusively,
carry himself well, play games reasonably well,
do nothing else well, and in the best possible form.
And the two brothers Douglas, who were really
very much alike, did honestly do their best to be
such plain and simple gentlemen as our country
demands, taking pretentious established things
seriously, and not being odd or intelligent—in
spite of those insurgent strands.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the strands were in them. Below the
surface the disturbing impulses worked and at
last forced their way out....</p>

<p class='c011'>In one Captain Douglas, as Mrs. Rampound
Pilby told the Lord Chancellor, the suppressed
ingenuity broke out in disconcerting mystifications
and practical jokes that led to a severance from
Portsmouth, in the other the pent-up passions
came out before the other ingredients in an uncontrollable
devotion to the obvious and challenging
femininity of Miss Madeleine Philips....
His training had made him proof against ordinary
women, deaf as it were to their charms,
but she—she had penetrated. And impulsive
forces that have been pent up—go with a bang
when they go....</p>

<p class='c011'>The first strand in the composition of Captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Douglas has still to be accounted for, the sinister
strain of intelligence and inventiveness and
lively curiosity. On that he had kept a warier
hold. So far that had not been noted against
him. He had his motor bicycle, it is true, at a
time when motor bicycles were on the verge of
the caddish; to that extent a watchful eye might
have found him suspicious; that was all that
showed. I wish I could add it was all that there
was, but other things—other things were going
on. Nobody knew about them. But they were
going on more and more.</p>

<p class='c011'>He read books.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not decent fiction, not official biographies
about other fellows’ fathers and all the old anecdotes
brought up to date and so on, but books
with ideas,—you know, philosophy, social philosophy,
scientific stuff, all that rot. <em>The sort of
stuff they read in mechanics’ institutes.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>He thought. He could have controlled it.
But he did not attempt to control it. He <em>tried</em>
to think. He knew perfectly well that it wasn’t
good form, but a vicious attraction drew him on.</p>

<p class='c011'>He used to sit in his bedroom-study at Sandhurst,
with the door locked, and write down on a
bit of paper what he really believed and why.
He would cut all sorts of things to do this. He
would question—things no properly trained
English gentleman ever questions.</p>

<p class='c011'>And—he experimented.</p>

<p class='c011'>This you know was long before the French and
American aviators. It was long before the coming
of that emphatic lead from abroad without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>which no well-bred English mind permits itself
to stir. In the darkest secrecy he used to make
little models of cane and paper and elastic in
the hope that somehow he would find out something
about flying. Flying—that dream! He
used to go off by himself to lonely places and climb
up as high as he could and send these things
fluttering earthward. He used to moon over
them and muse about them. If anyone came
upon him suddenly while he was doing these
things, he would sit on his model, or pretend it
didn’t belong to him, or clap it into his pocket,
whichever was most convenient, and assume
the vacuous expression of a well-bred gentleman
at leisure—and so far nobody had caught him.
But it was a dangerous practice.</p>

<p class='c011'>And finally, and this now is the worst and last
thing to tell of his eccentricities, he was keenly
interested in the science of his profession and intensely
ambitious.</p>

<p class='c011'>He thought—though it wasn’t his business to
think, the business of a junior officer is to obey
and look a credit to his regiment—that the military
science of the British army was not nearly so
bright as it ought to be, and that if big trouble
came there might be considerable scope for an
inventive man who had done what he could to
keep abreast with foreign work, and a considerable
weeding out of generals whose promotion had
been determined entirely by their seniority, amiability
and unruffled connubial felicity. He
thought that the field artillery would be found
out—there was no good in making a fuss about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>it beforehand—that no end of neglected dodges
would have to be picked up from the enemy, that
the transport was feeble, and a health service—other
than surgery and ambulance—an unknown
idea, but he saw no remedy but experience. So
he worked hard in secret; he worked almost as
hard as some confounded foreigner might have
done; in the belief that after the first horrid
smash-up there might be a chance to do things.</p>

<p class='c011'>Outwardly of course he was sedulously all right.
But he could not quite hide the stir in his mind.
It broke out upon his surface in a chattering
activity of incompleted sentences which he tried to
keep as decently silly as he could. He had done
his utmost hitherto to escape the observation of the
powers that were. His infatuation for Madeleine
Philips had at any rate distracted censorious attention
from these deeper infamies....</p>

<p class='c011'>And now here was a crisis in his life. Through
some idiotic entanglement manifestly connected
with this missing boy, he had got tarred by his
brother’s brush and was under grave suspicion
for liveliness and disrespect.</p>

<p class='c011'>The thing might be his professional ruin.
And he loved the suppressed possibilities of his
work beyond measure.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a thing to make him absent-minded
even in the company of Madeleine.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 5</h3>

<p class='c010'>Not only were the first and second strands in
the composition of Captain Douglas in conflict
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>with all his appearances and pretensions, but
they were also in conflict with one another.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was full of that concealed resolve to do
and serve and accomplish great things in the
world. That was surely purpose enough to hide
behind an easy-going unpretending gentlemanliness.
But he was also tremendously attracted
by Madeleine Philips, more particularly when
she was not there.</p>

<p class='c011'>A beautiful woman may be the inspiration of
a great career. This, however, he was beginning
to find was not the case with himself. He had
believed it at first and written as much and said
as much, and said it very variously and gracefully.
But becoming more and more distinctly clear to
his intelligence was the fact that the very reverse
was the case. Miss Madeleine Philips was making
it very manifest to Captain Douglas that she
herself was a career; that a lover with any other
career in view need not—as the advertisements
say—apply.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the time she took up!</p>

<p class='c011'>The distress of being with her!</p>

<p class='c011'>And the distress of <em>not</em> being with her!</p>

<p class='c011'>She was such a proud and lovely and entrancing
and distressing being to remember, and such a
vain and difficult thing to be with.</p>

<p class='c011'>She knew clearly that she was made for love,
for she had made herself for love; and she went
through life like its empress with all mankind
and numerous women at her feet. And she had
an ideal of the lover who should win her which
was like a oleographic copy of a Laszlo portrait of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Douglas greatly magnified. He was to rise rapidly
to great things, he was to be a conqueror and administrator,
while attending exclusively to her.
And incidentally she would gather desperate homage
from all other men of mark, and these attentions
would be an added glory to her love for him.
At first Captain Douglas had been quite prepared
to satisfy all these requirements. He had met her
at Shorncliffe, for her people were quite good military
people, and he had worshipped his way straight
to her feet. He had made the most delightfully
simple and delicate love to her. He had given up
his secret vice of thinking for the writing of quite
surprisingly clever love-letters, and the little white
paper models had ceased for a time to flutter in
lonely places.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then the thought of his career returned to
him, from a new aspect, as something he might
lay at her feet. And once it had returned to him
it remained with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some day,” he said, “and it may not be so
very long, some of those scientific chaps will
invent flying. Then the army will have to take
it up, you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should <em>love</em>,” she said, “to soar through the
air.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He talked one day of going on active service.
How would it affect them if he had to do so?
It was a necessary part of a soldier’s lot.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I should come too!” she said. “I should
come with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It might not be altogether convenient,” he
said, for already he had learnt that Madeleine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Philips usually travelled with quite a large number
of trunks and considerable impressiveness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course,” she said, “it would be splendid!
How could I let you go alone. You would be the
great general and I should be with you always.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not always very comfortable,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Silly boy!—I shouldn’t mind <em>that</em>! How
little you know me! Any hardship!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A woman—if she isn’t a nurse—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should come dressed as a man. I would be
your groom....”</p>

<p class='c011'>He tried to think of her dressed as a man, but
nothing on earth could get his imagination any
further than a vision of her dressed as a Principal
Boy. She was so delightfully and valiantly not
virile; her hair would have flowed, her body
would have moved, a richly fluent femininity—visible
through any disguise.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 6</h3>

<p class='c010'>That was in the opening stage of the controversy
between their careers. In those days
they were both acutely in love with each other.
Their friends thought the spectacle quite beautiful;
they went together so well. Admirers, fluttered
with the pride of participation, asked them for
week-ends together; those theatrical week-ends
that begin on Sunday morning and end on Monday
afternoon. She confided widely.</p>

<p class='c011'>And when at last there was something like a
rupture it became the concern of a large circle of
friends.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>The particulars of the breach were differently
stated. It would seem that looking ahead he had
announced his intention of seeing the French army
manœuvres just when it seemed probable that
she would be out of an engagement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I ought to see what they are doing,” he
said. “They’re going to try those new dirigibles.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then should she come?</p>

<p class='c011'>He wanted to whisk about. It wouldn’t be
any fun for her. They might get landed at nightfall
in any old hole. And besides people would
talk— Especially as it was in France. One
could do unconventional things in England one
couldn’t in France. Atmosphere was different.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a time after that halting explanation she
maintained a silence. Then she spoke in a voice
of deep feeling. She perceived, she said, that
he wanted his freedom. She would be the last
person to hold a reluctant lover to her side.
He might go—to <em>any</em> manœuvres. He might
go if he wished round the world. He might go
away from her for ever. She would not detain
him, cripple him, hamper a career she had once
been assured she inspired....</p>

<p class='c011'>The unfortunate man, torn between his love
and his profession, protested that he hadn’t
meant <em>that</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then what <em>had</em> he meant?</p>

<p class='c011'>He realized he had meant something remarkably
like it and he found great difficulty in expressing
these fine distinctions....</p>

<p class='c011'>She banished him from her presence for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>month, said he might go to his manœuvres—with
her blessing. As for herself, that was her
own affair. Some day perhaps he might know
more of the heart of a woman.... She choked
back tears—very beautifully, and military
science suddenly became a trivial matter. But
she was firm. He wanted to go. He must go.
For a month anyhow.</p>

<p class='c011'>He went sadly....</p>

<p class='c011'>Into this opening breach rushed friends. It
was the inestimable triumph of Judy Bowles to get
there first. To begin with, Madeleine confided
in her, and then, availing herself of the privilege
of a distant cousinship, she commanded Douglas
to tea in her Knightsbridge flat and had a good
straight talk with him. She liked good straight
talks with honest young men about their love
affairs; it was almost the only form of flirtation
that the Professor, who was a fierce, tough, undiscriminating
man upon the essentials of matrimony,
permitted her. And there was something
peculiarly gratifying about Douglas’s complexion.
Under her guidance he was induced to declare
that he could not live without Madeleine, that her
love was the heart of his life, without it he was
nothing and with it he could conquer the world....
Judy permitted herself great protestations
on behalf of Madeleine, and Douglas was worked
up to the pitch of kissing her intervening hand.
He had little silvery hairs, she saw, all over his
temples. And he was such a simple perplexed dear.
It was a rich deep beautiful afternoon for Judy.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then in a very obvious way Judy, who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>already deeply in love with the idea of a caravan
tour and the “wind on the heath” and the “Gipsy
life” and the “open road” and all the rest of it,
worked this charming little love difficulty into
her scheme, utilized her reluctant husband to
arrange for the coming of Douglas, confided in
Mrs. Geedge....</p>

<p class='c011'>And Douglas went off with his perplexities.
He gave up all thought of France, week-ended
at Shonts instead, to his own grave injury, returned
to London unexpectedly by a Sunday
train, packed for France and started. He reached
Rheims on Monday afternoon. And then the
image of Madeleine, which always became more
beautiful and mysterious and commanding with
every mile he put between them, would not let
him go on. He made unconvincing excuses to
the <cite>Daily Excess</cite> military expert with whom he
was to have seen things. “There’s a woman in it,
my boy, and you’re a fool to go,” said the <cite>Daily
Excess</cite> man, “but of course you’ll go, and I for
one don’t blame you—” He hurried back to
London and was at Judy’s trysting-place even
as Judy had anticipated.</p>

<p class='c011'>And when he saw Madeleine standing in the
sunlight, pleased and proud and glorious, with a
smile in her eyes and trembling on her lips, with
a strand or so of her beautiful hair and a streamer
or so of delightful blue fluttering in the wind about
her gracious form, it seemed to him for the moment
that leaving the manœuvres and coming
back to England was quite a right and almost
a magnificent thing to do.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>
  <div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 7</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This meeting was no exception to their other
meetings.</p>

<p class='c011'>The coming to her was a crescendo of poetical
desire, the sight of her a climax, and then—an
accumulation of irritations. He had thought
being with her would be pure delight, and as
they went over the down straying after the
Bowles and the Geedges towards the Redlake
Hotel he already found himself rather urgently
asking her to marry him and being annoyed by
what he regarded as her evasiveness.</p>

<p class='c011'>He walked along with the restrained movement
of a decent Englishman; he seemed as it were to
gesticulate only through his clenched teeth, and
she floated beside him, in a wonderful blue dress
that with a wonderful foresight she had planned
for breezy uplands on the basis of Botticelli’s
<cite>Primavera</cite>. He was urging her to marry him
soon; he needed her, he could not live in peace
without her. It was not at all what he had
come to say; he could not recollect that he had
come to say anything, but now that he was with
her it was the only thing he could find to say to
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, my dearest boy,” she said, “how are
we to marry? What is to become of <em>your</em> career
and <em>my</em> career?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve <em>left</em> my career!” cried Captain Douglas
with the first clear note of irritation in his voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! don’t let us quarrel,” she cried. “Don’t
let us talk of all those <em>distant</em> things. Let us be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>happy. Let us enjoy just this lovely day and
the sunshine and the freshness and the beauty....
Because you know we are snatching these
days. We have so few days together. Each—each
must be a gem.... Look, dear, how the
breeze sweeps through these tall dry stems that
stick up everywhere—low broad ripples.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was a perfect work of art, abolishing time
and obligations.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a time they walked in silence. Then
Captain Douglas said, “All very well—beauty
and all that—but a fellow likes to know where
he is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not answer immediately, and then she
said, “I believe you are angry because you have
come away from France.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not a bit of it,” said the Captain stoutly.
“I’d come away from anywhere to be with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder,” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,—haven’t I?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder if you ever are with me.... Oh!—I
know you <em>want</em> me. I know you desire me.
But the real thing, the happiness,—love. What
is anything to love—anything at all?”</p>

<p class='c011'>In this strain they continued until their footsteps
led them through the shelter of a group of
beeches. And there the gallant captain sought
expression in deeds. He kissed her hands, he
sought her lips. She resisted softly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” she said, “only if you love me with all
your heart.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then suddenly, wonderfully, conqueringly she
yielded him her lips.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“Oh!” she sighed presently, “if only you
understood.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And leaving speech at that enigma she kissed
again....</p>

<p class='c011'>But you see now how difficult it was under
these mystically loving conditions to introduce
the idea of a prompt examination and dispatch
of Bealby. Already these days were consecrated....</p>

<p class='c011'>And then you see Bealby vanished—going
seaward....</p>

<p class='c011'>Even the crash of the caravan disaster did little
to change the atmosphere. In spite of a certain
energetic quality in the Professor’s direction of
the situation—he was a little embittered because
his thumb was sprained and his knee bruised
rather badly and he had a slight abrasion over one
ear and William had bitten his calf—the general
disposition was to treat the affair hilariously.
Nobody seemed really hurt except William,—the
Professor was not so much hurt as annoyed,—and
William’s injuries though striking were all
superficial, a sprained jaw and grazes and bruises
and little things like that; everybody was
heartened up to the idea of damages to be paid
for; and neither the internal injuries to the
caravan nor the hawker’s estimate of his stock-in-trade
proved to be as great as one might
reasonably have expected. Before sunset the
caravan was safely housed in the Winthorpe-Sutbury
public house, William had found a
congenial corner in the bar parlour, where his
account of an inside view of the catastrophe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>and his views upon Professor Bowles were much
appreciated, the hawker had made a bit extra
by carting all the luggage to the Redlake Royal
Hotel and the caravanners and their menfolk
had loitered harmoniously back to this refuge.
Madeleine had walked along the road beside
Captain Douglas and his motor bicycle, which he
had picked up at the now desolate encampment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It only remains,” she said, “for that thing
to get broken.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I may want it,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” she said, “Heaven has poured us together
and now He has smashed the vessels.
At least He has smashed one of the vessels. And
look!—like a great shield, there is the moon.
It’s the Harvest Moon, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” said the Captain, with his poetry running
away with him. “It’s the Lovers’ Moon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s like a benediction rising over our meeting.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And it was certainly far too much like a benediction
for the Captain to talk about Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>That night was a perfect night for lovers, a
night flooded with a kindly radiance, so that the
warm mystery of the centre of life seemed to lurk
in every shadow and hearts throbbed instead
of beating and eyes were stars. After dinner
every one found wraps and slipped out into the
moonlight; the Geedges vanished like moths;
the Professor made no secret that Judy was
transfigured for him. Night works these miracles.
The only other visitors there, a brace of couples,
resorted to the boats upon the little lake.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Two enormous waiters removing the coffee
cups from the small tables upon the verandah
heard Madeleine’s beautiful voice for a little while
and then it was stilled....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 8</h3>

<p class='c010'>The morning found Captain Douglas in a state
of reaction. He was anxious to explain quite
clearly to Madeleine just how necessary it was
that he should go in search of Bealby forthwith.
He was beginning to realize now just what a
chance in the form of Bealby had slipped through
his fingers. He had dropped Bealby and now the
thing to do was to pick up Bealby again before
he was altogether lost. Her professional life
unfortunately had given Miss Philips the habit
of never rising before midday, and the Captain
had to pass the time as well as he could until
the opportunity for his explanation came.</p>

<p class='c011'>A fellow couldn’t go off without an explanation....</p>

<p class='c011'>He passed the time with Professor Bowles upon
the golf links.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Professor was a first-rate player and an
unselfish one; he wanted all other players to be
as good as himself. He would spare no pains to
make them so. If he saw them committing any
of the many errors into which golfers fall, he would
tell them of it and tell them why it was an error
and insist upon showing them just how to avoid it
in future. He would point out any want of
judgment, and not confine himself, as so many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>professional golf teachers do, merely to the stroke.
After a time he found it necessary to hint to the
Captain that nowadays a military man must
accustom himself to self-control. The Captain
kept Pishing and Tushing, and presently, it was
only too evident, swearing softly; his play got
jerky, his strokes were forcible without any real
strength, once he missed the globe altogether and
several times he sliced badly. The eyes under
his light eyelashes were wicked little things.</p>

<p class='c011'>He remembered that he had always detested golf.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the Professor. He had always detested
the Professor.</p>

<p class='c011'>And his caddie; at least he would have always
detested his caddie if he had known him long
enough. His caddie was one of those maddening
boys with no expression at all. It didn’t matter
what he did or failed to do, there was the silly
idiot with his stuffed face, unmoved. Really, of
course overjoyed—but apparently unmoved....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why did I play it that way?” the Captain
repeated. “Oh! because I like to play it that
way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Well</em>,” said the Professor. “It isn’t a recognized
way anyhow....”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then came a moment of evil pleasures.</p>

<p class='c011'>He’d sliced. Old Bowles had sliced. For
once in a while he’d muffed something. Always
teaching others and here he was slicing! Why,
sometimes the Captain didn’t slice!...</p>

<p class='c011'>He’d get out of that neatly enough. Luck!
He’d get the hole yet. What a bore it all was!...</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Why couldn’t Madeleine get up at a decent
hour to see a fellow? Why must she lie in bed
when she wasn’t acting? If she had got up all
this wouldn’t have happened. The shame of
it! Here he was, an able-bodied capable man in
the prime of life and the morning of a day playing
this blockhead’s game—!</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes—blockhead’s game!</p>

<p class='c011'>“You play the like,” said the Professor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Rather</em>,” said the Captain and addressed
himself to his stroke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s not your ball,” said the Professor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Similar position,” said the Captain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know, you might <em>win</em> this hole,” said
the Professor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who cares?” said the Captain under his
breath and putted extravagantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That saves me,” said the Professor, and went
down from a distance of twelve yards.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Captain, full of an irrational resentment,
did his best to halve the hole and failed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You ought to put in a week at nothing but
putting,” said the Professor. “It would save
you at least a stroke a hole. I’ve noticed that
on almost every green, if I haven’t beaten you
before I pull up in the putting.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Captain pretended not to hear and said a
lot of rococo things inside himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Madeleine who had got him in for this
game. A beautiful healthy girl ought to get up
in the mornings. Mornings and beautiful healthy
girls are all the same thing really. She ought
to be <em>dewy</em>—positively dewy.... There she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>must be lying, warm and beautiful in bed—like
Catherine the Great or somebody of that sort.
No. It wasn’t right. All very luxurious and so
on but not <em>right</em>. She ought to have understood
that he was bound to fall a prey to the Professor
if she didn’t get up. Golf! Here he was, neglecting
his career; hanging about on these <em>beastly</em>
links, all the sound men away there in France—it
didn’t do to think of it!—and he was playing
this retired tradesman’s consolation!</p>

<p class='c011'>(Beastly the Professor’s legs looked from behind.
The uglier a man’s legs are the better he plays
golf. It’s almost a law.)</p>

<p class='c011'>That’s what it was, a retired tradesman’s
consolation. A decent British soldier has no more
business to be playing golf than he has to be
dressing dolls. It’s a game at once worthless and
exasperating. If a man isn’t perfectly fit he
cannot play golf, and when he is perfectly fit he
ought to be doing a man’s work in the world.
If ever anything deserved the name of vice,
if ever anything was pure, unforgivable dissipation,
surely golf was that thing....</p>

<p class='c011'>And meanwhile that boy was getting more and
more start. Anyone with a ha’porth of sense
would have been up at five and after that brat—might
have had him bagged and safe and back
to lunch. <em>Ass</em> one was at times!</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’re here, sir,” said the caddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>The captain perceived he was in a nasty place,
open green ahead but with some tumbled country
near at hand and to the left, a rusty old gravel
pit, furze at the sides, water at the bottom.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Nasty attractive hole of a place. Sort of thing
one gets into. He must pull himself together for
this. After all, having undertaken to play a game
one must play the game. If he hit the infernal
thing, that is to say the ball, if he hit the ball
so that if it didn’t go straight it would go to the
right rather—clear of the hedge it wouldn’t
be so bad to the right. Difficult to manage.
Best thing was to think hard of the green ahead, a
long way ahead,—with just the slightest deflection
to the right. Now then,—heels well down, club
up, a good swing, keep your eye on the ball, keep
your eye on the ball, keep your eye on the ball
just where you mean to hit it—far below there
and a little to the right—and <em>don’t</em> worry....</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Rap.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>“In the pond I <em>think</em>, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The water would have splashed if it had gone
in the pond,” said the Professor. “It must be
over there in the wet sand. You hit it pretty
hard, I thought.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Search. The caddie looked as though he didn’t
care whether he found it or not. <em>He</em> ought to be
interested. It was his profession, not just his
game. But nowadays everybody had this horrid
disposition towards slacking. A Tired generation
we are. The world is too much with us. Too
much to think about, too much to do, Madeleines,
army manœuvres, angry lawyers, lost
boys—let alone such exhausting foolery as this
game....</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Got</em> it, sir!” said the caddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“Here, sir! Up in the bush, sir!”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was resting in the branches of a bush two
yards above the slippery bank.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I doubt if you can play it,” said the Professor,
“but it will be interesting to try.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Captain scrutinized the position. “I can
play it,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ll slip, I’m afraid,” said the Professor.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were both right. Captain Douglas drove
his feet into the steep slope of rusty sand below
the bush, held his iron a little short and wiped
the ball up and over and as he found afterwards
out of the rough. All eyes followed the ball
except his. The Professor made sounds of
friendly encouragement. But the Captain was
going—going. He was on all fours, he scrabbled
handfuls of prickly gorse, of wet sand. His
feet, his ankles, his calves slid into the pond.
How much more? No. He’d reached the
bottom. He proceeded to get out again as well
as he could. Not so easy. The bottom of
the pond sucked at him....</p>

<p class='c011'>When at last he rejoined the other three his
hands were sandy red, his knees were sandy red,
his feet were of clay, but his face was like the
face of a little child. Like the face of a little
fair child after it has been boiled red in its bath
and then dusted over with white powder.
His ears were the colour of roses, Lancaster roses.
And his eyes too had something of the angry
wonder of a little child distressed....</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was afraid you’d slip into the pond,” said
the Professor.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>“I didn’t,” said the Captain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I just got in to see how deep it was and cool
my feet—I hate warm feet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He lost that hole but he felt a better golfer now,
his anger he thought was warming him up so that
he would presently begin to make strokes by
instinct, and do remarkable things unawares.
After all there is something in the phrase “getting
one’s blood up.” If only the Professor wouldn’t
dally so with his ball and let one’s blood get down
again. Tap!—the Professor’s ball went soaring.
Now for it. The Captain addressed himself to
his task, altered his plans rather hastily, smote
and topped the ball.</p>

<p class='c011'>The least one could expect was a sympathetic
silence. But the Professor thought fit to improve
the occasion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ll never drive,” said the Professor;
“you’ll never drive with that <em>irritable</em> jerk in
the middle of the stroke. You might just as
well smack the ball without raising your club.
If you think—”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Captain lost his self-control altogether.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look here,” he said, “if <em>you</em> think that <em>I</em>
care a single rap about how I hit the ball, if you
think that I really want to win and do well at
this beastly, silly, elderly, childish game—.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He paused on the verge of ungentlemanly
language.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If a thing’s worth doing at all,” said the
Professor after a pause for reflection, “it’s worth
doing well.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“Then it isn’t worth doing at all. As this hole
gives you the game—if you don’t mind—”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Captain’s hot moods were so rapid that
already he was acutely ashamed of himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“O <em>certainly</em>, if you wish it,” said the Professor.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a gesture the Professor indicated the
altered situation to the respectful caddies and
the two gentlemen turned their faces towards the
hotel.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a time they walked side by side in silence,
the caddies following with hushed expressions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Splendid weather for the French manœuvres,”
said the Captain presently in an off-hand tone,
“that is to say if they are getting this weather.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At present there are a series of high pressure
systems over the whole of Europe north of the
Alps,” said the Professor. “It is as near set
fair as Europe can be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fine weather for tramps and wanderers,”
said the Captain after a further interval.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s a drawback to everything,” said the
Professor. “But it’s very lovely weather.”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 9</h3>

<p class='c010'>They got back to the hotel about half-past
eleven and the Captain went and had an unpleasant
time with one of the tyres of his motor
bicycle which had got down in the night. In
replacing the tyre he pinched the top of one of
his fingers rather badly. Then he got the ordnance
map of the district and sat at a green table in the
open air in front of the hotel windows and speculated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>on the probable flight of Bealby. He had
been last seen going south by east. That way
lay the sea, and all boy fugitives go naturally for
the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>He tried to throw himself into the fugitive’s
mind and work out just exactly the course Bealby
<em>must</em> take to the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a time he found this quite an absorbing
occupation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby probably had no money or very little
money. Therefore he would have to beg or
steal. He wouldn’t go to the workhouse because
he wouldn’t know about the workhouse, respectable
poor people never know anything about the
workhouse, and the chances were he would be both
too honest and too timid to steal. He’d beg. He’d
beg at front doors because of dogs and things,
and he’d probably go along a high road. He’d be
more likely to beg from houses than from passers-by,
because a door is at first glance less formidable
than a pedestrian and more accustomed to being
addressed. And he’d try isolated cottages rather
than the village street doors, an isolated wayside
cottage is so much more confidential. He’d ask for
food—not money. All that seemed pretty sound.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now this road on the map—into it he was
bound to fall and along it he would go begging.
No other?... No.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the fine weather he’d sleep out. And he’d
go—ten, twelve, fourteen—thirteen, thirteen
miles a day.</p>

<p class='c011'>So now, he ought to be about here. And to-night,—here.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>To-morrow at the same pace,—here.</p>

<p class='c011'>But suppose he got a lift!...</p>

<p class='c011'>He’d only get a slow lift if he got one at all.
It wouldn’t make much difference in the calculation....</p>

<p class='c011'>So if to-morrow one started and went on to
these cross roads marked <em>Inn</em>, just about twenty-six
miles it must be by the scale, and beat round it
one ought to get something in the way of tidings
of Mr. Bealby. Was there any reason why
Bealby shouldn’t go on south by east and seaward?...</p>

<p class='c011'>None.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now there remained nothing to do but to
explain all this clearly to Madeleine. And why
didn’t she come down? Why didn’t she come
down?</p>

<p class='c011'>But when one got Bealby what would one do
with him?</p>

<p class='c011'>Wring the truth out of him—half by threats
and half by persuasion. Suppose after all he
hadn’t any connexion with the upsetting of Lord
Moggeridge? He had. Suppose he hadn’t. He
had. He had. He had.</p>

<p class='c011'>And when one had the truth?</p>

<p class='c011'>Whisk the boy right up to London and confront
the Lord Chancellor with the facts. But
suppose he wouldn’t be confronted with the facts.
He was a touchy old sinner....</p>

<p class='c011'>For a time Captain Douglas balked at this
difficulty. Then suddenly there came into his head
the tall figure, the long moustaches of that kindly
popular figure, his adopted uncle Lord Chickney.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Suppose he took the boy straight to Uncle Chickney,
told him the whole story. Even the Lord
Chancellor would scarcely refuse ten minutes to
General Lord Chickney....</p>

<p class='c011'>The clearer the plans of Captain Douglas grew
the more anxious he became to put them before
Madeleine—clearly and convincingly....</p>

<p class='c011'>Because first he had to catch his boy....</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently, as Captain Douglas fretted at the
continued eclipse of Madeleine, his thumb went
into his waistcoat pocket and found a piece of
paper. He drew it out and looked at it. It was
a little piece of stiff note-paper cut into the shape
of a curved V rather after the fashion of a soaring
bird. It must have been there for months. He
looked at it. His care-wrinkled brow relaxed.
He glanced over his shoulder at the house and
then held this little scrap high over his head and
let go. It descended with a slanting flight curving
round to the left and then came about and swept
down to the ground to the right.... Now why
did it go like that? As if it changed its mind.
He tried it again. Same result.... Suppose
the curvature of the wings was a little greater?
Would it make a more acute or a less acute angle?
He did not know.... Try it.</p>

<p class='c011'>He felt in his pocket for a piece of paper, found
Lady Laxton’s letter, produced a stout pair of
nail scissors in a sheath from a waistcoat pocket,
selected a good clear sheet, and set himself to
cut out his improved V....</p>

<p class='c011'>As he did so his eyes were on V number one,
on the ground. It would be interesting to see if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>this thing turned about to the left again. If in
fact it would go on zig-zagging. It ought, he felt,
to do so. But to test that one ought to release it
from some higher point so as to give it a longer
flight. Stand on the chair?...</p>

<p class='c011'>Not in front of the whole rotten hotel. And
there was a beastly looking man in a green apron
coming out of the house,—the sort of man who
looks at you. He might come up and watch;
these fellows are equal to anything of that sort.
Captain Douglas replaced his scissors and scraps
in his pockets, leaned back with an affectation
of boredom, got up, lit a cigarette—sort of
thing the man in the green apron would think all
right—and strolled off towards a clump of
beech trees, beyond which were bushes and a depression.
There perhaps one might be free from
observation. Just try these things for a bit.
That point about the angle was a curious one;
it made one feel one’s ignorance not to know
that....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 10</h3>

<p class='c010'>The ideal King has a careworn look, he rules,
he has to do things, but the ideal Queen is radiant
happiness, tall and sweetly dignified, simply she
has to be things. And when at last towards
midday Queen Madeleine dispelled the clouds of
the morning and came shining back into the
world that waited outside her door, she was full
of thankfulness for herself and for the empire
that was given her. She knew she was a delicious
and wonderful thing, she knew she was well done,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>her hands, the soft folds of her dress as she held
it up, the sweep of her hair from her forehead
pleased her, she lifted her chin but not too high
for the almost unenvious homage in the eyes of
the housemaid on the staircase. Her descent
was well timed for the lunch gathering of the
hotel guests; there was “<em>Ah!</em>—here she comes
at last!” and there was her own particular court
out upon the verandah before the entrance,
Geedge and the Professor and Mrs. Bowles—and
Mrs. Geedge coming across the lawn,—and
the lover?</p>

<p class='c011'>She came on down and out into the sunshine.
She betrayed no surprise. The others met her
with flattering greetings that she returned smilingly.
But the lover—?</p>

<p class='c011'>He was not there!</p>

<p class='c011'>It was as if the curtain had gone up on almost
empty stalls.</p>

<p class='c011'>He ought to have been worked up and waiting
tremendously. He ought to have spent the
morning in writing a poem to her or in writing a
delightful poetical love letter she could carry
away and read or in wandering alone and thinking
about her. He ought to be feeling now like the
end of a vigil. He ought to be standing now, a
little in the background and with that pleasant
flush of his upon his face and that shy, subdued,
reluctant look that was so infinitely more flattering
than any boldness of admiration. And then she
would go towards him, for she was a giving type,
and hold out both hands to him, and he, as though
he couldn’t help it, in spite of all his British
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>reserve, would take one and hesitate—which
made it all the more marked—and kiss it....</p>

<p class='c011'>Instead of which he was just not there....</p>

<p class='c011'>No visible disappointment dashed her bravery.
She knew that at the slightest flicker Judy and
Mrs. Geedge would guess and that anyhow the
men would guess nothing. “I’ve rested,” she
said, “I’ve rested delightfully. What have you
all been doing?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Judy told of great conversations, Mr. Geedge
had been looking for trout in the stream, Mrs.
Geedge with a thin little smile said she had been
making a few notes and—she added the word
with deliberation—“observations,” and Professor
Bowles said he had had a round of golf
with the Captain. “And he lost?” asked Madeleine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’s careless in his drive and impatient at
the greens,” said the Professor modestly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He vanished,” said the Professor, recognizing
the true orientation of her interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a little pause and Mrs. Geedge said,
“You know—” and stopped short.</p>

<p class='c011'>Interrogative looks focussed upon her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s so odd,” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Curiosity increased.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose one ought not to say,” said Mrs.
Geedge, “and yet—why shouldn’t one?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Exactly,” said Professor Bowles, and every one
drew a little nearer to Mrs. Geedge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One can’t help being amused,” she said.
“It was so—extraordinary.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“Is it something about the Captain?” asked
Madeleine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. You see,—he didn’t see me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is he—is he writing poetry?” Madeleine was
much entertained and relieved at the thought.
That would account for everything. The poor
dear! He hadn’t been able to find some rhyme!</p>

<p class='c011'>But one gathered from the mysterious airs of
Mrs. Geedge that he was not writing poetry.
“You see,” she said, “I was lying out there
among the bushes, just jotting down a few little
things,—and he came by. And he went down
into the hollow out of sight.... And what do
you think he is doing? You’d never guess?
He’s been at it for twenty minutes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They didn’t guess.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’s playing with little bits of paper—Oh!
like a kitten plays with dead leaves. He throws
them up—and they flutter to the ground—and
then he pounces on them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—” said Madeleine. And then very
brightly, “let’s go and see!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was amazed. She couldn’t understand.
She hid it under a light playfulness, that threatened
to become distraught. Even when presently,
after a very careful stalking of the dell under the
guidance of Mrs. Geedge, with the others in
support, she came in sight of him, she still found
him incredible. There was her lover, her devoted
lover, standing on the top bar of a fence,
his legs wide apart and his body balanced with
difficulty, and in his fingers poised high was a
little scrap of paper. This was the man who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>should have been waiting in the hall with feverish
anxiety. His fingers released the little model
and down it went drifting....</p>

<p class='c011'>He seemed to be thinking of nothing else in the
world. She might never have been born!...</p>

<p class='c011'>Some noise, some rustle, caught his ear. He
turned his head quickly, guiltily, and saw her and
her companions.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then he crowned her astonishment. No
lovelight leapt to his eyes; he uttered no cry of
joy. Instead he clutched wildly at the air, shouted,
“Oh <em>damn</em>!” and came down with a complicated
inelegance on all fours upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was angry with her—angry; she could
see that he was extremely angry.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 11</h3>

<p class='c010'>So it was that the incompatibilities of man and
woman arose again in the just recovering love
dream of Madeleine Philips. But now the discord
was far more evident than it had been at
the first breach.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly her dear lover, her flatterer, her worshipper,
had become a strange averted man. He
scrabbled up two of his paper scraps before he
came towards her, still with no lovelight in his
eyes. He kissed her hand as if it was a matter of
course and said almost immediately: “I’ve been
hoping for you all the endless morning. I’ve had
to amuse myself as best I can.” His tone was
resentful. He spoke as if he had a claim upon
her—upon her attentions. As if it wasn’t entirely
upon his side that obligations lay.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>She resolved that shouldn’t deter her from
being charming.</p>

<p class='c011'>And all through the lunch she was as charming
as she could be, and under such treatment that
rebellious ruffled quality vanished from his manner,
vanished so completely that she could wonder
if it had really been evident at any time. The
alert servitor returned.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was only too pleased to forget the disappointment
of her descent and forgive him, and it
was with a puzzled incredulity that she presently
saw his “difficult” expression returning. It was
an odd little knitting of the brows, a faint absentmindedness,
a filming of the brightness of his
worship. He was just perceptibly indifferent to
the charmed and charming things she<a id='t180'></a> was saying.</p>

<p class='c011'>It seemed best to her to open the question
herself. “Is there something on your mind,
Dot?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dot” was his old school nickname.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, no—not exactly on my mind. But—.
It’s a bother of course. There’s that confounded
boy....”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Were you trying some sort of divination
about him? With those pieces of paper?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No. That was different. That was—just
something else. But you see that boy—. Probably
clear up the whole of the Moggeridge
bother—and you know it <em>is</em> a bother. Might
turn out beastly awkward....”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was extraordinarily difficult to express.
He wanted so much to stay with her and he
wanted so much to go.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>But all reason, all that was expressible, all
that found vent in words and definite suggestions,
was on the side of an immediate pursuit of Bealby.
So that it seemed to her he wanted and intended
to go much more definitely than he actually did.</p>

<p class='c011'>That divergence of purpose flawed a beautiful
afternoon, cast chill shadows of silence over their
talk, arrested endearments. She was irritated.
About six o’clock she urged him to go; she did not
mind, anyhow she had things to see to, letters to
write, and she left him with an effect of leaving
him for ever. He went and overhauled his motor
bicycle thoroughly and then an aching dread of
separation from her arrested him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dinner, the late June sunset and the moon
seemed to bring them together again. Almost
harmoniously he was able to suggest that he
should get up very early the next morning, pursue
and capture Bealby and return for lunch.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’d get up at dawn!” she cried. “But
how perfectly Splendid the midsummer dawn
must be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she had an inspiration. “Dot!” she
cried, “I will get up at dawn also and come with
you.... Yes, but as you say he cannot be
more than thirteen miles away we’d catch him
warm in his little bed somewhere. And the
freshness! The dewy freshness!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And she laughed her beautiful laugh and said it
would be “Such <em>Fun</em>!” entering as she supposed
into his secret desires and making the most perfect
of reconciliations. They were to have tea first,
which she would prepare with the caravan lamp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>and kettle. Mrs. Geedge would hand it over
to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>She broke into song. “A Hunting we will
go-ooh,” she sang. “A Hunting we will go....”</p>

<p class='c011'>But she could not conquer the churlish underside
of the Captain’s nature even by such efforts.
She threw a glamour of vigour and fun over the
adventure, but some cold streak in his composition
was insisting all the time that as a boy hunt
the attempt failed. Various little delays in her
preparations prevented a start before half-past
seven, he let that weigh with him, and when
sometimes she clapped her hands and ran—and
she ran like a deer, and sometimes she sang, he
said something about going at an even pace.</p>

<p class='c011'>At a quarter past one Mrs. Geedge observed
them returning. They were walking abreast and
about six feet apart, they bore themselves grimly,
after the manner of those who have delivered
ultimata, and they conversed no more....</p>

<p class='c011'>In the afternoon Madeleine kept her own
room, exhausted, and Captain Douglas sought
opportunities of speaking to her in vain. His
face expressed distress and perplexity, with
momentary lapses into wrathful resolution, and he
evaded Judy and her leading questions and talked
about the weather with Geedge. He declined a
proposal of the Professor’s to go round the links,
with especial reference to his neglected putting.
“You ought to, you know,” said the Professor.</p>

<p class='c011'>About half-past three, and without any publication
of his intention, Captain Douglas departed
upon his motor bicycle....</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Madeleine did not reappear until dinner-time,
and then she was clad in lace and gaiety that
impressed the naturally very good observation
of Mrs. Geedge as unreal.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 12</h3>

<p class='c010'>The Captain, a confusion of motives that was
as it were a mind returning to chaos, started.
He had seen tears in her eyes. Just for one
instant, but certainly they were tears. Tears of
vexation. Or sorrow? (Which is the worse
thing for a lover to arouse, grief or resentment?)
But this boy must be caught, because if he was
not caught a perpetually developing story of
imbecile practical joking upon eminent and
influential persons would eat like a cancer into
the Captain’s career. And if his career was
spoilt what sort of thing would he be as a lover?
Not to mention that he might never get a chance
then to try flying for military purposes....
So anyhow, anyhow, this boy must be caught.
But quickly, for women’s hearts are tender, they
will not stand exposure to hardship. There is
a kind of unreasonableness natural to goddesses.
Unhappily this was an expedition needing wariness,
deliberation, and one brought to it a feverish
hurry to get back. There must be self-control.
There must be patience. Such occasions try the
soldierly quality of a man....</p>

<p class='c011'>It added nothing to the Captain’s self-control
that after he had travelled ten miles he found he
had forgotten his quite indispensable map and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>had to return for it. Then he was seized again
with doubts about his inductions and went over
them again, sitting by the roadside. (There
must be patience.) ... He went on at a pace
of thirty-five miles an hour to the inn he had
marked upon his map as Bealby’s limit for the
second evening. It was a beastly little inn, it
stewed tea for the Captain atrociously and it
knew nothing of Bealby. In the adjacent cottages
also they had never heard of Bealby. Captain
Douglas revised his deductions for the third
time and came to the conclusion that he had not
made a proper allowance for Wednesday afternoon.
Then there was all Thursday, and the
longer, lengthening part of Friday. He might
have done thirty miles or more already. And
he might have crossed this corner—inconspicuously.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suppose he hadn’t after all come along this
road!</p>

<p class='c011'>He had a momentary vision of Madeleine
with eyes brightly tearful. “You left me for a
Wild Goose Chase,” he fancied her saying....</p>

<p class='c011'>One must stick to one’s job. A soldier more
particularly must stick to his job. Consider
Balaclava....</p>

<p class='c011'>He decided to go on along this road and try
the incidental cottages that his reasoning led him
to suppose were the most likely places at which
Bealby would ask for food. It was a business
demanding patience and politeness.</p>

<p class='c011'>So a number of cottagers, for the greater part
they were elderly women past the fiercer rush
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>and hurry of life, grandmothers and ancient
dames or wives at leisure with their children
away at the Council schools, had a caller that
afternoon. Cottages are such lonely places in
the daytime that even district visitors and canvassers
are godsends and only tramps ill received.
Captain Douglas ranked high in the scale of
visitors. There was something about him, his
fairness, a certain handsomeness, his quick colour,
his active speech, which interested women at all
times, and now an indefinable flow of romantic
excitement conveyed itself to his interlocutors.
He encountered the utmost civility everywhere;
doors at first tentatively ajar opened wider at
the sight of him and there was a kindly disposition
to enter into his troubles lengthily and deliberately.
People listened attentively to his demands,
and before they testified to Bealby’s sustained
absence from their perception they would for the
most part ask numerous questions in return.
They wanted to hear the Captain’s story, the
reason for his research, the relationship between
himself and the boy, they wanted to feel something
of the sentiment of the thing. After that
was the season for negative facts. Perhaps when
everything was stated they might be able to
conjure up what he wanted. He was asked in
to have tea twice, for he looked not only pink and
dusty, but dry, and one old lady said that years
ago she had lost just such a boy as Bealby seemed
to be—“Ah! not in the way <em>you</em> have lost
him”—and she wept, poor old dear! and was
only comforted after she had told the Captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>three touching but extremely lengthy and detailed
anecdotes of Bealby’s vanished prototype.</p>

<p class='c011'>(Fellow cannot rush away, you know; still all
this sort of thing, accumulating, means a confounded
lot of delay.)</p>

<p class='c011'>And then there was a deaf old man.... A
very, very tiresome deaf old man who said at
first he <em>had</em> seen Bealby....</p>

<p class='c011'>After all the old fellow was deaf....</p>

<p class='c011'>The sunset found the Captain on a breezy
common forty miles away from the Redlake
Royal Hotel and by this time he knew that fugitive
boys cannot be trusted to follow the lines
even of the soundest inductions. This business
meant a search.</p>

<p class='c011'>Should he pelt back to Redlake and start again
more thoroughly on the morrow?</p>

<p class='c011'>A moment of temptation.</p>

<p class='c011'>If he did he knew she wouldn’t let him go.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>No!</em></p>

<p class='c011'>NO!</p>

<p class='c011'>He must make a sweeping movement through
the country to the left, trying up and down the
roads that, roughly speaking, radiated from
Redlake between the twenty-fifth and the thirty-fifth
milestone....</p>

<p class='c011'>It was night and high moonlight when at last
the Captain reached Crayminster, that little old
town decayed to a village, in the Crays valley.
He was hungry, dispirited, quite unsuccessful,
and here he resolved to eat and rest for the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>He would have a meal, for by this time he was
ravenous, and then go and talk in the bar or the
tap about Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Until he had eaten he felt he could not endure
the sound of his own voice repeating what had
already become a tiresome stereotyped formula;
“You haven’t I suppose seen or heard anything
during the last two days of a small boy—little
chap of about thirteen—wandering about? He’s
a sturdy resolute little fellow with a high colour,
short wiry hair, rather dark....”</p>

<p class='c011'>The White Hart at Crayminster, after some
negotiations, produced mutton cutlets and Australian
hock. As he sat at his meal in the small
ambiguous respectable dining-room of the inn—adorned
with framed and glazed beer advertisements,
crinkled paper fringes and insincere sporting
prints—he became aware of a murmurous
confabulation going on in the bar parlour. It
must certainly he felt be the bar parlour....</p>

<p class='c011'>He could not hear distinctly, and yet it seemed
to him that the conversational style of Crayminster
was abnormally rich in expletive. And
the tone was odd. It had a steadfast quality of
commination.</p>

<p class='c011'>He brushed off a crumb from his jacket, lit a
cigarette and stepped across the passage to put
his hopeless questions.</p>

<p class='c011'>The talk ceased abruptly at his appearance.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was one of those deep-toned bar parlours
that are so infinitely more pleasant to the eye
than the tawdry decorations of the genteel accommodation.
It was brown with a trimming of
green paper hops and it had a mirror and glass
shelves sustaining bottles and tankards. Six or
seven individuals were sitting about the room.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>They had a numerous effect. There was a man
in very light floury tweeds, with a floury bloom
on his face and hair and an anxious depressed
expression. He was clearly a baker. He sat
forward as though he nursed something precious
under the table. Next him was a respectable-looking,
regular-featured fair man with a large
head, and a ruddy-faced butcher-like individual
smoked a clay pipe by the side of the fireplace.
A further individual with an alert intrusive look
might have been a grocer’s assistant associating
above himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Evening,” said the Captain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Evening,” said the man with the large hand
guardedly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Captain came to the hearthrug with an
affectation of ease.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose,” he began, “that you haven’t any
of you seen anything of a small boy, wandering
about. He’s a little chap about thirteen. Sturdy,
resolute-looking little fellow with a high colour,
short wiry hair, rather dark....”</p>

<p class='c011'>He stopped short, arrested by the excited
movements of the butcher’s pipe and by the
changed expressions of the rest of the company.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We—we seen ’im,” the man with the big
head managed to say at last.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We seen ’im all right,” said a voice out of the
darkness beyond the range of the lamp.</p>

<p class='c011'>The baker with the melancholy expression
interjected, “I don’t care if I don’t ever see ’im
again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” said the Captain, astonished to find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>himself suddenly beyond hoping on a hot fresh
scent. “Now all that’s very interesting. Where
did you see him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thunderin’ vicious little varmint,” said the
butcher. “Owdacious.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Benshaw,” said the voice from the shadows,
“’E’s arter ’im now with a shot gun loaded
up wi’ oats. ’E’ll pepper ’im if ’e gets ’im, Bill
will, you bet your ’at. And serve ’im jolly well
right <em>tew</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I doubt,” said the baker, “I doubt if I’ll ever
get my stummik—not thoroughly proper again.
It’s a Blow I’ve ’ad. ’E give me a Blow. Oh!
Mr. ’Orrocks, <em>could</em> I trouble you for another
thimbleful of brandy? Just a thimbleful neat.
It eases the ache....”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'>BEALBY AND THE TRAMP</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 1</h3>

<p class='c010'>Bealby was loth to leave the caravan party
even when by his own gross negligence it had
ceased to be a caravan party. He made off
regretfully along the crest of the hills through
bushes of yew and box until the clamour of the
disaster was no longer in his ears. Then he
halted for a time and stood sorrowing and listening
and then turned up by a fence along the
border of a plantation and so came into a little
overhung road.</p>

<p class='c011'>His ideas of his immediate future were vague
in the extreme. He was a receptive expectation.
Since his departure from the gardener’s cottage
circumstances had handed him on. They had
been interesting but unstable circumstances. He
supposed they would still hand him on. So far
as he had any definite view about his intentions
it was that he was running away to sea. And
that he was getting hungry.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was also, he presently discovered, getting
dark very gently and steadily. And the overhung
road after some tortuosities expired suddenly
upon the bosom of a great grey empty
common with distant mysterious hedges.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>It seemed high time to Bealby that something
happened of a comforting nature.</p>

<p class='c011'>Always hitherto something or someone had come
to his help when the world grew dark and cold,
and given him supper and put him or sent him to
bed. Even when he had passed a night in the
interstices of Shonts he had known there was a
bed at quite a little distance under the stairs.
If only that loud Voice hadn’t shouted curses
whenever he moved he would have gone to it.
But as he went across this common in the gloaming
it became apparent that this amiable routine
was to be broken. For the first time he realized
the world could be a homeless world.</p>

<p class='c011'>And it had become very still.</p>

<p class='c011'>Disagreeably still, and full of ambiguous
shadows.</p>

<p class='c011'>That common was not only an unsheltered
place, he felt, but an unfriendly place, and he
hurried to a gate at the further end. He kept
glancing to the right and to the left. It would
be pleasanter when he had got through that gate
and shut it after him.</p>

<p class='c011'>In England there are no grey wolves.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet at times one thinks of wolves, grey wolves,
the colour of twilight and running noiselessly,
almost noiselessly, at the side of their prey for
quite a long time before they close in on it.</p>

<p class='c011'>In England, I say, there are no grey wolves.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wolves were extinguished in the reign of
Edward the Third; it was in the histories, and
since then no free wolf has trod the soil of England;
only menagerie captives.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Of course there may be <em>escaped</em> wolves!</p>

<p class='c011'>Now the gate!—sharp through it and slam
it behind you, and a little brisk run and so into
this plantation that slopes down hill. This is a
sort of path; vague, but it must be a path. Let
us hope it is a path.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>What was that among the trees?</em></p>

<p class='c011'>It stopped, surely it stopped, as Bealby stopped.
Pump, pump—. Of course! that was one’s
heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nothing there! Just fancy. Wolves live in
the open; they do not come into woods like this.
And besides, there are no wolves. And if one
shouts—even if it is but a phantom voice one
produces, they go away. They are cowardly
things—really. Such as there aren’t.</p>

<p class='c011'>And there is the power of the human eye.</p>

<p class='c011'>Which is why they stalk you and watch you
and evade you when you look and creep and
creep and creep behind you!</p>

<p class='c011'>Turn sharply.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nothing.</p>

<p class='c011'>How this stuff rustled under the feet! In
woods at twilight, with innumerable things darting
from trees and eyes watching you everywhere,
it would be pleasanter if one could walk without
making quite such a row. Presently, surely,
Bealby told himself, he would come out on a
high road and meet other people and say “good-night”
as they passed. Jolly other people they
would be, answering, “Good-night.” He was
now going at a moistening trot. It was getting
darker and he stumbled against things.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>When you tumble down wolves leap. Not of
course that there <em>are</em> any wolves.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was stupid to keep thinking of wolves in
this way. Think of something else. Think of
things beginning with a B. Beautiful things,
boys, beads, butterflies, bears. The mind stuck
at bears. <em>Are there such things as long grey bears?</em>
Ugh! Almost endless, noiseless bears?...</p>

<p class='c011'>It grew darker until at last the trees were
black. The night was swallowing up the flying
Bealby and he had a preposterous persuasion
that it had teeth and would begin at the back of
his legs....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 2</h3>

<p class='c010'>“Hi!” cried Bealby weakly, hailing the glow
of the fire out of the darkness of the woods above.</p>

<p class='c011'>The man by the fire peered at the sound; he
had been listening to the stumbling footsteps
for some time, and he answered nothing.</p>

<p class='c011'>In another minute Bealby had struggled through
the hedge into the visible world and stood regarding
the man by the fire. The phantom wolves
had fled beyond Sirius. But Bealby’s face was
pale still from the terrors of the pursuit and
altogether he looked a smallish sort of small
boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lost?” said the man by the fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Couldn’t find my way,” said Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anyone with you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The man reflected. “Tired?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bit.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>“Come and sit down by the fire and rest yourself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I won’t ’urt you,” he added as Bealby hesitated.</p>

<p class='c011'>So far in his limited experience Bealby had
never seen a human countenance lit from behind
by a flickering red flame. The effect he found
remarkable rather than pleasing. It gave this
stranger the most active and unstable countenance
Bealby had ever seen. The nose seemed to
be in active oscillation between pug and Roman,
the eyes jumped out of black caves and then
went back into them, the more permanent features
appeared to be a vast triangle of neck and
chin. The tramp would have impressed Bealby
as altogether inhuman if it had not been for the
smell of cooking he diffused. There were onions
in it and turnips and pepper—mouth-watering
constituents, testimonials to virtue. He was
making a stew in an old can that he had slung
on a cross stick over a brisk fire of twigs that he
was constantly replenishing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I won’t ’urt you, darn you,” he repeated.
“Come and sit down on these leaves here for a
bit and tell me all abart it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby did as he was desired. “I got lost,”
he said, feeling too exhausted to tell a good story.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tramp, examined more closely, became
less pyrotechnic. He had a large loose mouth, a
confused massive nose, much long fair hair, a
broad chin with a promising beard and spots—a
lot of spots. His eyes looked out of deep sockets
and they were sharp little eyes. He was a lean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>man. His hands were large and long and they
kept on with the feeding of the fire as he sat and
talked to Bealby. Once or twice he leant forward
and smelt the pot judiciously, but all the time
the little eyes watched Bealby very closely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lose yer collar?” said the tramp.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby felt for his collar. “I took it orf,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come far?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Over there,” said Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Over there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What place?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t know the name of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then it ain’t your ’ome?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ve run away,” said the man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pr’aps I ’ave,” said Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pr’aps you ’ave! Why pr’aps? You <em>’ave</em>!
What’s the good of telling lies abart it? When’d
you start?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Monday,” said Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tramp reflected. “Had abart enough of
it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dunno,” said Bealby truthfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Like some soup?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Ow much?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I could do with a lot,” said Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah yah! I didn’t mean that. I meant,
’ow much for some? ’Ow much will you pay for
a nice, nice ’arf can of soup? I ain’t a darn
charity. See?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>“Tuppence,” said Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tramp shook his head slowly from side to
side and took out the battered iron spoon he was
using to stir the stuff and tasted the soup lusciously.
It was—jolly good soup and there
were potatoes in it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thrippence,” said Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Ow much you got?” asked the tramp.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby hesitated perceptibly. “Sixpence,” he
said weakly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s sixpence,” said the tramp. “Pay up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Ow big a can?” asked Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tramp felt about in the darkness behind
him and produced an empty can with a jagged
mouth that had once contained, the label witnessed—I
quote, I do not justify—‘<em>Deep Sea
Salmon</em>.’ “That,” he said, “and this chunk of
bread.... Right enough?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You <em>will</em> do it?” said Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do I look a swindle?” cried the tramp, and
suddenly a lump of the abundant hair fell over
one eye in a singularly threatening manner.
Bealby handed over the sixpence without further
discussion. “I’ll treat you fairly, you see,” said
the tramp, after he had spat on and pocketed the
sixpence, and he did as much. He decided that
the soup was ready to be served and he served it
with care. Bealby began at once. “There’s a
nextry onion,” said the tramp, throwing one over.
“It didn’t cost me much and I gives it you for
nothin’. That’s all right, eh? Here’s ’ealth!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby consumed his soup and bread meekly
with one eye upon his host. He would, he decided,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>eat all he could and then sit a little while, and then
get this tramp to tell him the way to—anywhere
else. And the tramp wiped soup out of his can
with gobbets of bread very earnestly and meditated
sagely on Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You better pal in with me, matey, for a bit,”
he said at last. “You can’t go nowhere else—not
to-night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Couldn’t I walk perhaps to a town or sumpthing?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“These woods ain’t safe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Ow d’you mean?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ever ’eard tell of a gurrillia?—sort of big
black monkey thing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Bealby faintly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s been one loose abart ’ere—oh week or
more. Fact. And if you wasn’t a grown up
man quite and going along in the dark, well—’e
might say something <em>to</em> you.... Of course ’e
wouldn’t do nothing where there was a fire or a
man—but a little chap like you. I wouldn’t
like to let you do it, ’strewth I wouldn’t. It’s
risky. Course I don’t want to <em>keep</em> you. There
it is. You go if you like. But I’d rather you
didn’t. ’Onest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where’d he come from?” asked Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“M’nagery,” said the tramp.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’E very near bit through the fist of a chap
that tried to stop ’im,” said the tramp.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby after weighing tramp and gorilla very
carefully in his mind decided he wouldn’t and
drew closer to the fire—but not too close—and
the conversation deepened.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>§ 3</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It was a long and rambling conversation and
the tramp displayed himself at times as quite an
amiable person. It was a discourse varied by
interrogations, and as a thread of departure and
return it dealt with the life of the road and with
life at large and—life, and with matters of ‘must’
and ‘may.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometimes and more particularly at first Bealby
felt as though a ferocious beast lurked in the
tramp and peeped out through the fallen hank
of hair and might leap out upon him, and sometimes
he felt the tramp was large and fine and
gay and amusing, more particularly when he
lifted his voice and his bristling chin. And ever
and again the talker became a nasty creature and
a disgusting creature, and his red-lit face was an
ugly creeping approach that made Bealby recoil.
And then again he was strong and wise. So the
unstable needle of a boy’s moral compass spins.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tramp used strange terms. He spoke of
the ‘deputy’ and the ‘doss-house,’ of the ‘spike’
and ‘padding the hoof,’ of ‘screevers’ and ‘tarts’
and ‘copper’s narks.’ To these words Bealby
attached such meanings as he could, and so the
things of which the tramp talked floated unsurely
into his mind and again and again he had to readjust
and revise his interpretations. And through
these dim and fluctuating veils a new side of life
dawned upon his consciousness, a side that was
strange and lawless and dirty—in every way
dirty—and dreadful and—attractive. That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>was the queer thing about it, that attraction. It
had humour. For all its squalor and repulsiveness
it was lit by defiance and laughter, bitter
laughter perhaps, but laughter. It had a gaiety
that Mr. Mergleson for example did not possess,
it had a penetration, like the penetrating quality
of onions or acids or asafœtida, that made the
memory of Mr. Darling insipid.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tramp assumed from the outset that Bealby
had ‘done something’ and run away, and some
mysterious etiquette prevented his asking directly
what was the nature of his offence. But he made
a number of insidious soundings. And he assumed
that Bealby was taking to the life of the
road and that, until good cause to the contrary
appeared, they were to remain together. “It’s
a tough life,” he said, “but it has its points, and
you got a toughish look about you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He talked of roads and the quality of roads and
countryside. This was a good countryside; it
wasn’t overdone and there was no great hostility
to wanderers and sleeping out. Some roads—the
London to Brighton for example, if a chap
struck a match, somebody came running. But
here unless you went pulling the haystacks about
too much they left you alone. And they weren’t
such dead nuts on their pheasants, and one had a
chance of an empty cowshed. “If I’ve spotted a
shed or anything with a roof to it I stay out,”
said the tramp, “even if it’s raining cats and dogs.
Otherwise it’s the doss-’ouse or the ‘spike.’
It’s the rain is the worst thing—getting wet.
You haven’t been wet yet, not if you only started
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Monday. Wet—with a chilly wind to drive it.
Gaw! I been blown out of a holly hedge. You
<em>would</em> think there’d be protection in a holly
hedge....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Spike’s the last thing,” said the tramp.
“I’d rather go bare-gutted to a doss-’ouse anywhen.
Gaw!—you’ve not ’ad your first taste
of the spike yet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But it wasn’t heaven in the doss-houses. He
spoke of several of the landladies in strange
but it would seem unflattering terms. “And
there’s always such a blamed lot of washing going
on in a doss-’ouse. Always washing they are!
One chap’s washing ’is socks and another’s washing
’is shirt. Making a steam drying it. Disgustin’.
Carn’t see what they want with it all.
Barnd to git dirty again....”</p>

<p class='c011'>He discoursed of spikes, that is to say of work-houses,
and of masters. “And then,” he said,
with revolting yet alluring adjectives, “there’s
the bath.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s the worst side of it,” said the tramp....
“’Owever, it doesn’t always rain, and if it
doesn’t rain, well, you can keep yourself dry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He came back to the pleasanter aspects of
the nomadic life. He was all for the outdoor
style. “Ain’t we comfortable ’ere?” he asked.
He sketched out the simple larcenies that had contributed
and given zest to the evening’s meal.
But it seemed there were also doss-houses that
had the agreeable side. “Never been in one!”
he said. “But where you been sleeping since
Monday?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Bealby described the caravan in phrases that
seemed suddenly thin and anæmic to his ears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You hit it lucky,” said the tramp. “If a
chap’s a kid he strikes all sorts of luck of that sort.
Now ef <em>I</em> come up against three ladies travellin’
in a van—think they’d arst me in? Not it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He dwelt with manifest envy on the situation
and the possibilities of the situation for some
time. “You ain’t dangerous,” he said; “that’s
where you get in....”</p>

<p class='c011'>He consoled himself by anecdotes of remarkable
good fortunes of a kindred description.
Apparently he sometimes travelled in the company
of a lady named Izzy Berners—“a fair scorcher,
been a regular, slap-up circus actress.” And
there was also “good old Susan.” It was a little
difficult for Bealby to see the point of some of
these flashes by a tendency on the part of the
tramp while his thoughts turned on these matters
to adopt a staccato style of speech, punctuated by
brief, darkly significant guffaws. There grew
in the mind of Bealby a vision of the doss-house
as a large crowded place, lit by a great central
fire, with much cooking afoot and much jawing
and disputing going on, and then “me and Izzy
sailed in....”</p>

<p class='c011'>The fire sank, the darkness of the woods seemed
to creep nearer. The moonlight pierced the
trees only in long beams that seemed to point
steadfastly at unseen things, it made patches of
ashen light that looked like watching faces.
Under the tramp’s direction Bealby skirmished
round and got sticks and fed the fire until the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>darkness and thoughts of a possible gorilla were
driven back for some yards and the tramp pronounced
the blaze a “fair treat.” He had made a
kind of bed of leaves which he now invited Bealby
to extend and share, and lying feet to the fire
he continued his discourse.</p>

<p class='c011'>He talked of stealing and cheating by various
endearing names; he made these enterprises seem
adventurous and facetious; there was it seemed
a peculiar sort of happy find one came upon
called a “flat,” that it was not only entertaining
but obligatory to swindle. He made fraud seem
so smart and bright at times that Bealby found it
difficult to keep a firm grasp on the fact that it was—fraud....</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby lay upon the leaves close up to the prone
body of the tramp, and his mind and his standards
became confused. The tramp’s body was a
dark but protecting ridge on one side of him;
he could not see the fire beyond his toes but its
flickerings were reflected by the tree stems about
them, and made perplexing sudden movements
that at times caught his attention and made him
raise his head to watch them.... Against
the terrors of the night the tramp had become
humanity, the species, the moral basis. His
voice was full of consolation; his topics made
one forget the watchful silent circumambient.
Bealby’s first distrusts faded. He began to
think the tramp a fine, brotherly, generous
fellow. He was also growing accustomed to a
faint something—shall I call it an olfactory bar—that
had hitherto kept them apart.  The monologue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>ceased to devote itself to the elucidation of
Bealby; the tramp was lying on his back with his
fingers interlaced beneath his head and talking
not so much to his companion as to the stars and
the universe at large. His theme was no longer
the wandering life simply but the wandering life
as he had led it, and the spiritedness with which
he had led it and the real and admirable quality
of himself. It was that soliloquy of consolation
which is the secret preservative of innumerable lives.</p>

<p class='c011'>He wanted to make it perfectly clear that he
was a tramp by choice. He also wanted to make
it clear that he was a tramp and no better because
of the wicked folly of those he had trusted and
the evil devices of enemies. In the world that
contained those figures of spirit; Isopel Berners
and Susan, there was also it seemed a bad and
spiritless person, the tramp’s wife, who had done
him many passive injuries. It was clear she did
not appreciate her blessings. She had been much
to blame. “Anybody’s opinion is better than
’er ’usband’s,” said the tramp. “Always ’as
been.” Bealby had a sudden memory of Mr.
Darling saying exactly the same thing of his
mother. “She’s the sort,” said the tramp, “what
would rather go to a meetin’ than a music ’all.
She’d rather drop a shilling down a crack than
spend it on anything decent. If there was a choice
of jobs going she’d ask which ’ad the lowest pay
and the longest hours and she’d choose <em>that</em>.
She’d feel safer. She was born scared. When
there wasn’t anything else to do she’d stop at
’ome and scrub the floors. Gaw! it made a chap
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>want to put the darn’ pail over ’er ’ed, so’s she’d
get enough of it....</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t hold with all this crawling through
life and saying <em>Please</em>,” said the tramp. “I say
it’s <em>my</em> world just as much as it’s <em>your</em> world.
You may have your ’orses and carriages, your
’ouses and country places and all that and you
may think Gawd sent me to run abart and work
for you; but <em>I</em> don’t. See?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby saw.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I seek my satisfactions just as you seek your
satisfactions, and if you want to get me to work
you’ve jolly well got to make me. I don’t choose
to work. I choose to keep on my own and a bit
loose and take my chance where I find it. You
got to take your chances in this world. Sometimes
they come bad and sometimes they come
good. And very often you can’t tell which it is
when they ’ave come....”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he fell questioning Bealby again and then
he talked of the immediate future. He was
beating for the seaside. “Always something
doing,” he said. “You got to keep your eye on
for cops; those seaside benches, they’re ’ot on
tramps—give you a month for begging soon as
look at you—but there’s flats dropping sixpences
thick as flies on a sore ’orse. You want a there
for all sorts of jobs. You’re just the chap for
it, matey. Saw it soon’s ever I set eyes on
you....”</p>

<p class='c011'>He made projects....</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally he became more personal and very
flattering.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>“Now you and me,” he said, suddenly shifting
himself quite close to Bealby, “we’re going to be
downright pals. I’ve took a liking to you. Me
and you are going to pal together. See?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He breathed into Bealby’s face, and laid a
hand on his knee and squeezed it, and Bealby, on
the whole, felt honoured by his protection....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 4</h3>

<p class='c010'>In the unsympathetic light of a bright and
pushful morning the tramp was shorn of much
of his overnight glamour. It became manifest
that he was not merely offensively unshaven, but
extravagantly dirty. It was not ordinary rural
dirt. During the last few days he must have had
dealings of an intimate nature with coal. He
was taciturn and irritable, he declared that this
sleeping out would be the death of him and the
breakfast was only too manifestly wanting in the
comforts of a refined home. He seemed a little
less embittered after breakfast, he became even
faintly genial, but he remained unpleasing. A
distaste for the tramp arose in Bealby’s mind and
as he walked on behind his guide and friend, he
revolved schemes of unobtrusive detachment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Far be it from me to accuse Bealby of ingratitude.
But it is true that that same disinclination
which made him a disloyal assistant
to Mr. Mergleson was now affecting his comradeship
with the tramp. And he was deceitful. He
allowed the tramp to build projects in the confidence
of his continued adhesion, he did not warn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>him of the defection he meditated. But on the
other hand Bealby had acquired from his mother
an effective horror of stealing. And one must
admit, since the tramp admitted it, that the man
stole.</p>

<p class='c011'>And another little matter had at the same time
estranged Bealby from the tramp and linked the
two of them together. The attentive reader will
know that Bealby had exactly two shillings and
twopence-halfpenny when he came down out of
the woods to the fireside. He had Mrs. Bowles’
half-crown and the balance of Madeleine Philips’
theatre shilling, minus sixpence halfpenny for a
collar and sixpence he had given the tramp for
the soup overnight. But all this balance was now
in the pocket of the tramp. Money talks and the
tramp had heard it. He had not taken it away
from Bealby, but he had obtained it in this
manner: “We two are pals,” he said, “and one
of us had better be Treasurer. That’s Me. I
know the ropes better. So hand over what you
got there, matey.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And after he had pointed out that a refusal
might lead to Bealby’s evisceration the transfer
occurred. Bealby was searched, kindly but
firmly....</p>

<p class='c011'>It seemed to the tramp that this trouble had
now blown over completely.</p>

<p class='c011'>Little did he suspect the rebellious and treacherous
thoughts that seethed in the head of his companion.
Little did he suppose that his personal
appearance, his manners, his ethical flavour—nay,
even his physical flavour—were being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>judged in a spirit entirely unamiable. It seemed
to him that he had obtained youthful and subservient
companionship, companionship that
would be equally agreeable and useful; he had
adopted a course that he imagined would cement
the ties between them; he reckoned not with
ingratitude. “If anyone arsts you who I am,
call me uncle,” he said. He walked along, a
little in advance, sticking his toes out right and
left in a peculiar wide pace that characterized
his walk, and revolving schemes for the happiness
and profit of the day. To begin with—great
draughts of beer. Then tobacco. Later perhaps
a little bread and cheese for Bealby. “You
can’t come in ’ere,” he said at the first public
house. “You’re under age, me boy. It ain’t
my doing, matey; it’s ’Erbert Samuel. You
blame ’im. ’E don’t objec’ to you going to work
for any other Mr. Samuel there may ’appen to
be abart or anything of that sort, that’s good for
you, that is; but ’e’s most particular you shouldn’t
go into a public ’ouse. So you just wait abart
outside ’ere. <em>I’ll</em> ’ave my eye on you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You going to spend my money?” asked
Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m going to ration the party,” said the
tramp.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You—you got no right to spend my money,”
said Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—’Ang it!—I’ll get you some acid drops,”
said the tramp in tones of remonstrance. “I
tell you, blame you,—it’s ‘Erbert Samuel.’ I
can’t ’elp it! I can’t fight against the lor.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>“You haven’t any right to spend my money,”
said Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Downt</em> cut up crusty. ’Ow can <em>I</em> ’elp it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll tell a policeman. You gimme back my
money and lemme go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The tramp considered the social atmosphere. It
did not contain a policeman. It contained nothing
but a peaceful kindly corner public house, a sleeping
dog and the back of an elderly man digging.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tramp approached Bealby in a confidential
manner. “’Oo’s going to believe you?” he
said. “And besides, ’ow did you come by it?</p>

<p class='c011'>“Moreover, <em>I</em> ain’t going to spend <em>your</em>
money. I got money of my own. <em>’Ere!</em> See?”
And suddenly before the dazzled eyes of Bealby
he held and instantly withdrew three shillings
and two coppers that seemed familiar. He had
had a shilling of his own....</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby waited outside....</p>

<p class='c011'>The tramp emerged in a highly genial mood,
with acid drops, and a short clay pipe going
strong. “’Ere,” he said to Bealby with just the
faintest flavour of magnificence over the teeth-held
pipe and handed over not only the acid drops
but a virgin short clay. “Fill,” he said, proffering
the tobacco. “It’s yours jus’ much as it’s
mine. Be’r not let ’Erbert Samuel see you,
though; that’s all. ’E’s got a lor abart it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby held his pipe in his clenched hand. He
had already smoked—once. He remembered it
quite vividly still, although it had happened six
months ago. Yet he hated not using that tobacco.
“No,” he said, “I’ll smoke later.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>The tramp replaced the screw of red Virginia
in his pocket with the air of one who has done
the gentlemanly thing....</p>

<p class='c011'>They went on their way, an ill-assorted couple.</p>

<p class='c011'>All day Bealby chafed at the tie and saw the
security in the tramp’s pocket vanish. They
lunched on bread and cheese and then the tramp
had a good sustaining drink of beer for both of
them and after that they came to a common where
it seemed agreeable to repose. And after a due
meed of repose in a secluded hollow among the
gorse the tramp produced a pack of exceedingly
greasy cards and taught Bealby to play Euchre.
Apparently the tramp had no distinctive pockets
in his tail coat, the whole lining was one capacious
pocket. Various knobs and bulges indicated his
cooking tin, his feeding tin, a turnip and other
unknown properties. At first they played for
love and then they played for the balance in the
tramp’s pocket. And by the time Bealby had
learnt Euchre thoroughly, that balance belonged
to the tramp. But he was very generous about it
and said they would go on sharing just as they
had done. And then he became confidential.
He scratched about in the bagginess of his garment
and drew out a little dark blade of stuff,
like a flint implement, regarded it gravely for a
moment and held it out to Bealby. “Guess what
this is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby gave it up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Smell it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It smelt very nasty. One familiar smell indeed
there was with a paradoxical sanitary quality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>that he did not quite identify, but that was a
mere basis for a complex reek of acquisitions.
“What is it?” said Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Soap!</em>”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what’s it for?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought you’d arst that.... What’s
soap usually for?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Washing,” said Bealby guessing wildly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tramp shook his head. “Making a foam,”
he corrected. “That’s what I has my fits with.
See? I shoves a bit in my mouth and down I
goes and I rolls about. Making a sort of moaning
sound. Why, I been given brandy often—neat
brandy.... It isn’t always a cert—nothing’s
absolutely a cert. I’ve ’ad some let-downs....
Once I was bit by a nasty little dog—that brought
me to pretty quick—and once I ’ad an old gentleman
go through my pockets. ‘Poor chap!’ ’e ses,
‘very likely ’e’s destitoot, let’s see if ’e’s <em>got</em>
anything.’... I’d got all sorts of things, I
didn’t want <em>’im</em> prying about. But I didn’t
come?to sharp enough to stop ’im. Got me into
trouble that did....</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s an old lay,” said the tramp, “but it’s
astonishing ’ow it’ll go in a quiet village. Sort
of amuses ’em. Or dropping suddenly in front of
a bicycle party. Lot of them old tricks are the
best tricks, and there ain’t many of ’em Billy
Bridget don’t know. That’s where you’re lucky
to ’ave met me, matey. Billy Bridget’s a ’ard
man to starve. And I know the ropes. I know
what you <em>can</em> do and what you can’t do. And
I got a feeling for a policeman—same as some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>people ’ave for cats. I’d know if one was ’idden
in the room....”</p>

<p class='c011'>He expanded into anecdotes and the story of
various encounters in which he shone. It was
amusing and it took Bealby on his weak side.
Wasn’t he the Champion Dodger of the Chelsome
playground?</p>

<p class='c011'>The tide of talk ebbed. “Well,” said the tramp,
“time we was up and doing....”</p>

<p class='c011'>They went along shady lanes and across an
open park and they skirted a breezy common
from which they could see the sea. And among
other things that the tramp said was this, “Time
we began to forage a bit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He turned his large observant nose to the right
of him and the left.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 5</h3>

<p class='c010'>Throughout the afternoon the tramp discoursed
upon the rights and wrongs of property, in a way
that Bealby found very novel and unsettling.
The tramp seemed to have his ideas about owning
and stealing arranged quite differently from those
of Bealby. Never before had Bealby thought it
possible to have them arranged in any other than
the way he knew. But the tramp contrived to
make most possession seem unrighteous and
honesty a code devised by those who have for
those who haven’t. “They’ve just got ’old of
it,” he said. “They want to keep it to themselves....
Do I look as though I’d stole much
of anybody’s? It isn’t me got ’old of this land
and sticking up my notice boards to keep everybody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>off. It isn’t me spends my days and nights
scheming ’ow I can get ’old of more and more
of the stuff....</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t <em>envy</em> it ’em,” said the tramp. “Some
’as one taste and some another. But when it
comes to making all this fuss because a chap
who <em>isn’t</em> a schemer ’elps ’imself to a mäthful,—well,
it’s Rot....</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s them makes the rules of the game and
nobody ever arst me to play it. I don’t blame
’em, mind you. Me and you might very well do
the same. But brast me if I see where the sense
of <em>my</em> keeping the rules comes in. This world
ought to be a share out, Gawd meant it to be a
share out. And me and you—we been done out
of our share. That justifies us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It isn’t right to steal,” said Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It isn’t right to steal—certainly. It isn’t
right—but it’s universal. Here’s a chap here over
this fence, ask ’im where ’e got ’is land. Stealing!
What you call stealing, matey, <em>I</em> call restitootion.
You ain’t probably never even ’eard of socialism.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve ’eard of socialists right enough. Don’t
believe in Gawd and ’aven’t no morality.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t you believe it. Why!—’Arf the socialists
are parsons. What I’m saying <em>is</em> socialism—practically.
<em>I’m</em> a socialist. I know all abart
socialism. There isn’t nothing you can tell me
abart socialism. Why!—for three weeks I was
one of these here Anti-Socialist speakers. Paid
for it. And I tell you there ain’t such a thing as
property left; it’s all a blooming old pinch.
Lords, commons, judges, all of them, they’re
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>just a crew of brasted old fences and the lawyers
getting in the stuff. Then you talk to me of
stealing! <em>Stealing!</em>”</p>

<p class='c011'>The tramp’s contempt and his intense way of
saying ‘stealing’ were very unsettling to a sensitive
mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>They bought some tea and grease in a village
shop and the tramp made tea in his old tin with
great dexterity and then they gnawed bread on
which two ounces of margarine had been generously
distributed. “Live like fighting cocks, we
do,” said the tramp wiping out his simple cuisine
with the dragged-out end of his shirt sleeve.
“And if I’m not very much mistaken we’ll sleep
to-night on a nice bit of hay....”</p>

<p class='c011'>But these anticipations were upset by a sudden
temptation, and instead of a starry summer comfort
the two were destined to spend a night of
suffering and remorse.</p>

<p class='c011'>A green lane lured them off the road, and after
some windings led them past a field of wire-netted
enclosures containing a number of perfect
and conceited-looking hens close beside a little
cottage, a vegetable garden and some new elaborate
outhouses. It was manifestly a poultry
farm, and something about it gave the tramp
the conviction that it had been left, that nobody
was at home.</p>

<p class='c011'>These realizations are instinctive, they leap
to the mind. He knew it, and an ambition to
know further what was in the cottage came with
the knowledge. But it seemed to him desirable
that the work of exploration should be done by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Bealby. He had thought of dogs, and it seemed
to him that Bealby might be unembarrassed by
that idea. So he put the thing to Bealby. “Let’s
have a look round ere,” he said. “You go in
and see what’s abart....”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was some difference of opinion. “I
don’t ask you to take anything,” said the tramp....
“Nobody won’t catch you.... I tell
you nobody won’t catch you.... I tell you
there ain’t nobody here to catch you.... Just
for the fun of seeing in. I’ll go up by them
outhouses. And I’ll see nobody comes....
Ain’t afraid to go up a garden path, are you?...
I tell you, I don’t want you to steal....
You ain’t got much guts to funk a thing like that....
I’ll be abät too.... Thought you’d be
the very chap for a bit of scarting.... Thought
Boy Scarts was all the go nowadays.... Well,
if you ain’t afraid you’d do it.... Well, why
didn’t you say you’d do it at the beginning?...”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby went through the hedge and up a grass
track between poultry runs, made a cautious inspection
of the outhouses and then approached
the cottage. Everything was still. He thought
it more plausible to go to the door than peep
into the window. He rapped. Then after an
interval of stillness he lifted the latch, opened the
door and peered into the room. It was a
pleasantly furnished room, and before the empty
summer fireplace a very old white man was
sitting in a chintz-covered arm-chair, lost it would
seem in painful thought. He had a peculiar
grey shrunken look, his eyes were closed, a bony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>hand with the shiny texture of alabaster gripped
the chair arm.... There was something about
him that held Bealby quite still for a moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>And this old gentleman behaved very oddly.</p>

<p class='c011'>His body seemed to crumple into his chair,
his hands slipped down from the arms, his head
nodded forwards and his mouth and eyes seemed
to open together. And he made a snoring
sound....</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Bealby remained rigidly agape
and then a violent desire to rejoin the tramp
carried him back through the hen runs....</p>

<p class='c011'>He tried to describe what he had seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Asleep with his mouth open,” said the tramp.
“Well, that ain’t anything so wonderful! You <em>got</em>
anything? That’s what I want to know....
Did anyone ever see such a boy? ’Ere! I’ll
go....</p>

<p class='c011'>“You keep a look out here,” said the tramp.</p>

<p class='c011'>But there was something about that old man
in there, something so strange and alien to Bealby,
that he could not remain alone in the falling
twilight. He followed the cautious advances of
the tramp towards the house. From the corner
by the outhouses he saw the tramp go and peer in
at the open door. He remained for some time
peering, his head hidden from Bealby....</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he went in....</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby had an extraordinary desire that somebody
else would come. His soul cried out for
help against some vaguely apprehended terror.
And in the very moment of his wish came its
fulfilment. He saw advancing up the garden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>path a tall woman in a blue serge dress, hatless
and hurrying and carrying a little package—it
was medicine—in her hand. And with her
came a big black dog. At the sight of Bealby
the dog came forward barking and Bealby after
a moment’s hesitation turned and fled.</p>

<p class='c011'>The dog was quick. But Bealby was quicker.
He went up the netting of a hen run and gave the
dog no more than an ineffectual snap at his heels.
And then dashing from the cottage door came the
tramp. Under one arm was a brass-bound workbox
and in the other was a candlestick and some
smaller articles. He did not instantly grasp the
situation of his treed companion, he was too
anxious to escape the tall woman, and then with a
yelp of dismay he discovered himself between
woman and dog. All too late he sought to emulate
Bealby. The workbox slipped from under his
arm, the rest of his plunder fell from him, for an
uneasy moment he was clinging to the side of the
swaying hen run and then it had caved in and the
dog had got him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The dog bit, desisted and then finding itself
confronted by two men retreated. Bealby and
the tramp rolled and scrambled over the other
side of the collapsed netting into a parallel track
and were halfway to the hedge before the dog,—but
this time in a less vehement fashion,—resumed
his attack.</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not close with them again and at the
hedge he halted altogether and remained hacking
the gloaming with his rage.</p>

<p class='c011'>The woman it seemed had gone into the house,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>leaving the tramp’s scattered loot upon the field
of battle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This means mizzle,” said the tramp, leading
the way at a trot.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby saw no other course but to follow.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had a feeling as though the world had turned
against him. He did not dare to think what he
was nevertheless thinking of the events of these
crowded ten minutes. He felt he had touched
something dreadful; that the twilight was full of
accusations.... He feared and hated the tramp
now, but he perceived something had linked
them as they had not been linked before. Whatever
it was they shared it.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 6</h3>

<p class='c010'>They fled through the night; it seemed to
Bealby for interminable hours. At last when they
were worn out and footsore they crept through a
gate and found an uncomfortable cowering place
in the corner of a field.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they went they talked but little, but the
tramp kept up a constant muttering to himself.
He was troubled by the thought of hydrophobia.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know I’ll ’ave it,” he said, “I know I’ll get
it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby after a time ceased to listen to his companion.
His mind was preoccupied. He could
think of nothing but that very white man in the
chair and the strange manner of his movement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was ’e awake when you saw ’im?” he asked
at last.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>“Awake—who?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That old man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment or so the tramp said nothing.
“’E wasn’t awake, you young silly,” he said at
last.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—wasn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why!—don’t you know! ’E’d croaked,—popped
off the ’ooks—very moment you saw
’im.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Bealby’s voice failed him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he said quite faintly, “You mean—he’d —.
Was dead?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Didn’t you know?” said the tramp. “Gaw!
What a kid you are!”</p>

<p class='c011'>In that manner it was Bealby first saw a dead
man. Never before had he seen anyone dead.
And after that for all the night the old white
man pursued him, with strange slowly-opening
eyes, and a head on one side and his mouth
suddenly and absurdly agape....</p>

<p class='c011'>All night long that white figure presided over
seas of dark dismay. It seemed always to be
there, and yet Bealby thought of a score of other
painful things. For the first time in his life he
asked himself, “Where am I going? What am I
drifting to?” The world beneath the old man’s
dominance was a world of prisons.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby believed he was a burglar and behind
the darkness he imagined the outraged law
already seeking him. And the terrors of his
associate reinforced his own.</p>

<p class='c011'>He tried to think what he should do in the morning.
He dreaded the dawn profoundly. But he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>could not collect his thoughts because of the
tramp’s incessant lapses into grumbling lamentation.
Bealby knew he had to get away from the
tramp, but now he was too weary and alarmed to
think of running away as a possible expedient.
And besides there was the matter of his money.
And beyond the range of the tramp’s voice there
were darknesses which to-night at least might
hold inconceivable forms of lurking evil. But
could he not appeal to the law to save him?
Repent? Was there not something called turning
King’s Evidence?</p>

<p class='c011'>The moon was no comfort that night. Across
it there passed with incredible slowness a number
of jagged little black clouds, blacker than any
clouds Bealby had ever seen before. They were
like velvet palls, lined with snowy fur. There
was no end to them. And one at last most
horribly gaped slowly and opened a mouth....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 7</h3>

<p class='c010'>At intervals there would be uncomfortable
movements and the voice of the tramp came out
of the darkness beside Bealby lamenting his
approaching fate and discoursing—sometimes
with violent expressions—on watch-dogs.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know I shall ’ave ’idrophobia,” said the
tramp. “I’ve always ’ad a disposition to ’idrophobia.
Always a dread of water—and now
it’s got me.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Think of it!—keeping a beast to set at a
’uman being. Where’s the brotherhood of it?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Where’s the law and the humanity? Getting a
animal to set at a brother man. And a poisoned
animal, a animal with death in his teeth. And
a ’orrible death too. Where’s the sense and
brotherhood?</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gaw! when I felt ’is teeth coming through
my träsers—!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dogs oughtn’t to be allowed. They’re a
noosance in the towns and a danger in the country.
They oughtn’t to be allowed anywhere—not till
every blessed ’uman being ’as got three square
meals a day. Then if you like, keep a dog.
And see ’e’s a clean dog....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gaw! if I’d been a bit quicker up that ’en
roost—!</p>

<p class='c011'>“I ought to ’ave landed ’im a kick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s a man’s duty to ’urt a dog. When ’e
sees a dog ’e ought to ’urt ’im. It’s a natural
’atred. If dogs were what they ought to be,
if dogs understood ’ow they’re situated, there
wouldn’t be a dog go for a man ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And if one did they’d shoot ’im....</p>

<p class='c011'>“After this if ever I get a chance to land a
dog a oner with a stone I’ll land ’im one. I
been too sorft with dogs....”</p>

<p class='c011'>Towards dawn Bealby slept uneasily, to be
awakened by the loud snorting curiosity of three
lively young horses. He sat up in a blinding
sunshine and saw the tramp looking very filthy
and contorted, sleeping with his mouth wide
open and an expression of dismay and despair on
his face.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>
  <div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 8</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Bealby took his chance to steal away next
morning while the tramp was engaged in artificial
epilepsy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I feel like fits this morning,” said the tramp.
“I could do it well. I want a bit of human
kindness again. After that brasted dog.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I expect soon I’ll ’ave the foam all right
withat  any soap.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They marked down a little cottage before which
a benevolent-looking spectacled old gentleman
in a large straw hat and a thin alpaca jacket was
engaged in budding roses. Then they retired to
prepare. The tramp handed over to Bealby
various compromising possessions, which might
embarrass an afflicted person under the searching
hands of charity. There was for example the
piece of soap after he had taken sufficient for his
immediate needs, there was ninepence in money,
there were the pack of cards with which they had
played Euchre, a key or so and some wires, much
assorted string, three tins, a large piece of bread,
the end of a composite candle, a box of sulphur
matches, list slippers, a pair of gloves, a clasp
knife, sundry grey rags. They all seemed to
have the distinctive flavour of the tramp....</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you do a bunk with these,” said the tramp.
“By Gawd—.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He drew his finger across his throat.</p>

<p class='c011'>(King’s Evidence.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby from a safe distance watched the beginnings
of the fit and it impressed him as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>thoroughly nasty kind of fit. He saw the elderly
gentleman hurry out of the cottage and stand for
a moment looking over his little green garden
gate, surveying the sufferings of the tramp with
an expression of intense yet discreet commiseration.
Then suddenly he was struck by an idea;
he darted in among his rose bushes and reappeared
with a big watering-can and an enormous syringe.
Still keeping the gate between himself and the
sufferer he loaded his syringe very carefully and
deliberately....</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby would have liked to have seen more but
he felt his moment had come. Another instant
and it might be gone again. Very softly he
dropped from the gate on which he was sitting
and made off like a running partridge along the
hedge of the field.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just for a moment did he halt—at a strange
sharp yelp that came from the direction of the
little cottage. Then his purpose of flight resumed
its control of him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He would strike across country for two or three
miles, then make for the nearest police station
and give himself up. (Loud voices. Was that
the tramp murdering the benevolent old gentleman
in the straw hat or was it the benevolent old
gentleman in the straw hat murdering the tramp?
No time to question. Onward, Onward!) The
tramp’s cans rattled in his pocket. He drew one
out, hesitated a moment and flung it away and
then sent its two companions after it....</p>

<p class='c011'>He found his police station upon the road between
Someport and Crayminster, a little peaceful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>rural station, a mere sunny cottage with a
blue and white label and a notice board covered
with belated bills about the stealing of pheasants’
eggs. And another bill—.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was headed MISSING and the next most
conspicuous words were £5 <span class='fss'>REWARD</span> and the
next ARTHUR BEALBY.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was fascinated. So swift, so terribly swift
is the law. Already they knew of his burglary,
of his callous participation in the robbing of a
dead man. Already the sleuths were upon his
trail. So surely did his conscience strike to this
conclusion that even the carelessly worded offer
of a reward that followed his description conveyed
no different intimation to his mind. “To whomsoever
will bring him back to Lady Laxton, at
Shonts near Chelsmore,” so it ran.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And out of pocket expenses.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And even as Bealby read this terrible document,
the door of the police station opened and a very
big pink young policeman came out and stood
regarding the world in a friendly, self-approving
manner. He had innocent, happy, blue eyes;
thus far he had had much to do with order and
little with crime; and his rosebud mouth would
have fallen open, had not discipline already
closed it and set upon it the beginnings of a
resolute expression that accorded ill with the
rest of his open freshness. And when he had surveyed
the sky and the distant hills and the little
rose bushes that occupied the leisure of the force,
his eyes fell upon Bealby....</p>

<p class='c011'>Indecision has ruined more men than wickedness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>And when one has slept rough and eaten
nothing and one is conscious of a marred unclean
appearance, it is hard to face one’s situations.
What Bealby had intended to do was to go right
up to a policeman and say to him, simply and
frankly: “I want to turn King’s Evidence, please.
I was in that burglary where there was a dead
old man and a workbox and a woman and a dog.
I was led astray by a bad character and I did not
mean to do it. And really it was him that did
it and not me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But now his tongue clove to the roof of his
mouth, he felt he could not speak, could not go
through with it. His heart had gone down into
his feet. Perhaps he had caught the tramp’s
constitutional aversion to the police. He affected
not to see the observant figure in the doorway.
He assumed a slack careless bearing like one who
reads by chance idly. He lifted his eyebrows to
express unconcern. He pursed his mouth to
whistle but no whistle came. He stuck his hands
into his pockets, pulled up his feet as one pulls
up plants by the roots and strolled away.</p>

<p class='c011'>He quickened his stroll as he supposed by imperceptible
degrees. He glanced back and saw
that the young policeman had come out of the
station and was reading the notice. And as the
young policeman read he looked ever and again
at Bealby like one who checks off items.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby quickened his pace and then, doing his
best to suggest by the movements of his back a
more boyish levity quite unconnected with the law,
he broke into a trot.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Then presently he dropped back into a walking
pace, pretended to see something in the hedge,
stopped and took a sidelong look at the young
policeman.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was coming along with earnest strides;
every movement of his suggested a stealthy hurry!</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby trotted and then becoming almost frank
about it ran. He took to his heels.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the first it was not really an urgent
chase; it was a stalking rather than a hunt,
because the young policeman was too young and
shy and lacking in confidence really to run after
a boy without any definite warrant for doing so.
When anyone came along he would drop into a
smart walk and pretend not to be looking at
Bealby but just going somewhere briskly. And
after two miles of it he desisted, and stood for
a time watching a heap of mangold wurzel directly
and the disappearance of Bealby obliquely, and
then when Bealby was quite out of sight he turned
back thoughtfully towards his proper place.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the whole he considered he was well out of
it. He might have made a fool of himself....</p>

<p class='c011'>And yet,—five pounds reward!</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'>THE BATTLE OF CRAYMINSTER</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 1</h3>

<p class='c010'>Bealby was beginning to realize that running
away from one’s situation and setting up for
oneself is not so easy and simple a thing as it had
appeared during those first days with the caravan.
Three things he perceived had arisen to pursue
him, two that followed in the daylight, the law
and the tramp, and a third that came back at
twilight, the terror of the darkness. And within
there was a hollow faintness, for the afternoon was
far advanced and he was extremely hungry.
He had dozed away the early afternoon in the
weedy corner of a wood. But for his hunger I
think he would have avoided Crayminster.</p>

<p class='c011'>Within a mile of that place he had come upon
the ‘Missing’ notice again stuck to the end of a
barn. He had passed it askance, and then with
a sudden inspiration returned and tore it down.
Somehow with the daylight his idea of turning
King’s Evidence against the tramp had weakened.
He no longer felt sure.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mustn’t one wait and be asked first to turn
King’s Evidence?</p>

<p class='c011'>Suppose they said he had merely confessed....</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>The Crayminster street had a picturesque
nutritious look. Half-way down it was the
White Hart with cyclist club signs on its walls
and geraniums over a white porch, and beyond
a house being built and already at the roofing
pitch. To the right was a baker’s shop diffusing
a delicious suggestion of buns and cake and to
the left a little comfortable sweetstuff window
and a glimpse of tables and a board: ‘Teas.’
Tea! He resolved to break into his ninepence
boldly and generously. Very likely they would
boil him an egg for a penny or so. Yet on the
other hand if he just had three or four buns, soft
new buns. He hovered towards the baker’s
shop and stopped short. That bill was in the
window!</p>

<p class='c011'>He wheeled about sharply and went into the
sweetstuff shop and found a table with a white
cloth and a motherly little woman in a large cap.
Tea? He could have an egg and some thick
bread and butter and a cup of tea for fivepence.
He sat down respectfully to await her preparations.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he was uneasy.</p>

<p class='c011'>He knew quite well that she would ask him
questions. For that he was prepared. He said
he was walking from his home in London to
Someport to save the fare. “But you’re so
dirty!” said the motherly little woman. “I
sent my luggage by post, ma’m, and I lost my
way and didn’t get it. And I don’t much mind,
ma’m, if you don’t. Not washing....”</p>

<p class='c011'>All that he thought he did quite neatly. But
he wished there was not that bill in the baker’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>window opposite and he wished he hadn’t quite
such a hunted feeling. A faint claustrophobia
affected him. He felt the shop might be a trap.
He would be glad to get into the open again.
Was there a way out behind if for example a
policeman blocked the door? He hovered to the
entrance while his egg was boiling and then when
he saw a large fat baker surveying the world
with an afternoon placidity upon his face, he
went back and sat by the table. He wondered
if the baker had noted him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had finished his egg; he was drinking his
tea with appreciative noises, when he discovered
that the baker <em>had</em> noted him. Bealby’s eyes, at
first inanely open above the tilting tea cup, were
suddenly riveted on something that was going on
in the baker’s window. From where he sat he
could see that detestable bill, and then slowly,
feeling about for it, he beheld a hand and a floury
sleeve. The bill was drawn up and vanished and
then behind a glass shelf of fancy bread and a
glass shelf of buns something pink and indistinct
began to move jerkily.... It was a human
face and it was trying to peer into the little refreshment
shop that sheltered Bealby....</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby’s soul went faint.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had one inadequate idea. “Might I go
out,” he said, “by your back way?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There isn’t a back way,” said the motherly
little woman. “There’s a yard—.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I might,” said Bealby, and was out in it.</p>

<p class='c011'>No way at all! High walls on every side. He
was back like a shot in the shop, and now the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>baker was half-way across the road. “Fivepence,”
said Bealby and gave the little old woman
sixpence. “Here,” she cried, “take your penny!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not wait. He darted out of the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>The baker was all over the way of escape. He
extended arms that seemed abnormally long and
with a weak cry Bealby found himself trapped.
Trapped, but not hopelessly. He knew how to do
it. He had done it in milder forms before, but
now he did it with all his being. Under the
diaphragm of the baker smote Bealby’s hard
little head, and instantly he was away running
up the quiet sunny street. Man when he assumed
the erect attitude made a hostage of his
belly. It is a proverb among the pastoral Berbers
of the Atlas mountains that the man who extends
his arms in front of an angry ram is a fool.</p>

<p class='c011'>It seemed probable to Bealby that he would get
away up the street. The baker was engaged in
elaborately falling backward, making the most of
sitting down in the road, and the wind had been
knocked out of him so that he could not shout.
He emitted “Stop him!” in large whispers.
Away ahead there were only three builder’s men
sitting under the wall beyond the White Hart,
consuming tea out of their tea cans. But the
boy who was trimming the top of the tall privet
hedge outside the doctor’s saw the assault of
the baker and incontinently uttered the shout
that the baker could not. Also he fell off his
steps with great alacrity and started in pursuit
of Bealby. A young man from anywhere—perhaps
the grocer’s shop—also started for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>Bealby. But the workmen were slow to rise to
the occasion. Bealby could have got past them.
And then, abruptly at the foot of the street
ahead the tramp came into view, a battered disconcerting
figure. His straw-coloured hat which
had recently been wetted and dried in the sun
was a swaying mop. The sight of Bealby seemed
to rouse him from some disagreeable meditations.
He grasped the situation with a terrible quickness.
Regardless of the wisdom of the pastoral Berbers
he extended his arms and stood prepared to
intercept.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby thought at the rate of a hundred
thoughts to the minute. He darted sideways
and was up the ladder and among the beams and
rafters of the unfinished roof before the pursuit
had more than begun. “Here, come off that,”
cried the foreman builder, only now joining in
the hunt with any sincerity. He came across the
road while Bealby regarded him wickedly from
the rafters above. Then as the good man made
to ascend Bealby got him neatly on the hat,
it was a bowler hat, with a tile. This checked
the advance. There was a disposition to draw a
little off and look up at Bealby. One of the
younger builders from the opposite sidewalk got
him very neatly in the ribs with a stone. But two
other shots went wide and Bealby shifted to a
more covered position behind the chimney stack.</p>

<p class='c011'>From here, however, he had a much less effective
command of the ladder, and he perceived that
his tenure of the new house was not likely to be a
long one.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>Below, men parleyed. “Who <em>is</em> ’e?” asked
the foreman builder. “Where’d ’e come from?”
“’E’s a brasted little thief,” said the tramp.
“’E’s one of the wust characters on the road.”
The baker was recovering his voice now.
“There’s a reward out for ’im,” he said, “and ’e
butted me in the stummick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Ow much reward?” asked the foreman
builder.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Five pound for the man who catches him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Ere!” cried the foreman builder in an arresting
voice to the tramp. “Just stand away from
that ladder....”</p>

<p class='c011'>Whatever else Bealby might or might not be,
one thing was very clear about him and that
was that he was a fugitive. And the instinct
of humanity is to pursue fugitives. Man is a
hunting animal, enquiry into the justice of a case
is an altogether later accretion to his complex
nature, and that is why, whatever you are or
whatever you do, you should never let people get
you on the run. There is a joy in the mere fact
of hunting, the sight of a scarlet coat and a hound
will brighten a whole village, and now Crayminster
was rousing itself like a sleeper who wakes
to sunshine and gay music. People were looking
out of windows and coming out of shops, a policeman
appeared and heard the baker’s simple story,
a brisk hatless young man in a white apron and
with a pencil behind his ear became prominent.
Bealby, peeping over the ridge of the roof, looked
a thoroughly dirty and unpleasant little creature
to all these people. The only spark of human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>sympathy for him below was in the heart of the
little old woman in the cap who had given him
his breakfast. She surveyed the roof of the new
house from the door of her shop, she hoped Bealby
wouldn’t hurt himself up there, and she held his
penny change clutched in her hand in her apron
pocket with a vague idea that perhaps presently
if he ran past she could very quickly give it
him.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 2</h3>

<p class='c010'>Considerable delay in delivering the assault on
the house was caused by the foreman’s insistence
that he alone should ascend the ladder to capture
Bealby. He was one of those regular-featured
men with large heads who seem to have inflexible
backbones, he was large and fair and full with a
sweetish chest voice and in all his movements
authoritative and deliberate. Whenever he made
to ascend he discovered that people were straying
into his building, and he had to stop and direct
his men how to order them off. Inside his large
head he was trying to arrange everybody to cut
off Bealby’s line of retreat without risking that
anybody but himself should capture the fugitive.
It was none too easy and it knitted his brows.
Meanwhile Bealby was able to reconnoitre the
adjacent properties and to conceive plans for a
possible line of escape. He also got a few tiles
handy against when the rush up the ladder came.
At the same time two of the younger workmen
were investigating the possibility of getting at
him from inside the house. There was still no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>staircase, but there were ways of clambering.
They had heard about the reward and they knew
that they must do this before the foreman realized
their purpose, and this a little retarded them.
In their pockets they had a number of stones,
ammunition in reserve, if it came again to throwing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby was no longer fatigued nor depressed;
anxiety for the future was lost in the excitement
of the present, and his heart told him that, come
what might, getting on to the roof was an extraordinarily
good dodge.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if only he could bring off a certain jump he
had in mind, there were other dodges—....</p>

<p class='c011'>In the village street an informal assembly of
leading citizens, a little recovered now from their
first nervousness about flying tiles, discussed
the problem of Bealby. There was Mumby, the
draper and vegetarian, with the bass voice and
the big black beard. He advocated the fire
engine. He was one of the volunteer fire brigade
and never so happy as when he was wearing
his helmet. He had come out of his shop at
the shouting. Schocks the butcher, and his boy
were also in the street. Schocks’s yard, with its
heap of manure and fodder, bounded the new house
on the left. Rymell the vet emerged from the
billiard room of the White Hart, and with his head
a little on one side was watching Bealby and
replying attentively to the baker, who was asking
him a number of questions that struck him as
irrelevant. All the White Hart people were in
the street.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>“I suppose, Mr. Rymell,” said the baker,
“there’s a mort of dangerous things in a man’s
belly round about ’is Stummick?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tiles,” said Mr. Rymell. “Loose bricks. It
wouldn’t do if he started dropping those.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was saying, Mr. Rymell,” said the baker,
after a pause for digestion, “is a man likely
to be injured badly by a Blaw in his stummick?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Rymell stared at him for a moment with
unresponsive eyes. “More likely to get you in
the head,” he said, and then, “Here! What’s
that fool of a carpenter going to do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The tramp was hovering on the outskirts of
the group of besiegers, vindictive but dispirited.
He had been brought to from his fit and given a
shilling by the old gentleman, but he was dreadfully
wet between his shirt—he wore a shirt,
under three waistcoats and a coat—and his
skin, because the old gentleman’s method of
revival had been to syringe him suddenly with
cold water. It had made him weep with astonishment
and misery. Now he saw no advantage
in claiming Bealby publicly. His part, he felt,
was rather a waiting one. What he had to say
to Bealby could be best said without the assistance
of a third person. And he wanted to understand
more of this talk about a reward. If there was a
reward out for Bealby—</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s not a bad dodge!” said Rymell, changing
his opinion of the foreman suddenly as that
individual began his ascent of the ladder with
a bricklayer’s hod carried shield-wise above his
head. He went up with difficulty and slowly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>because of the extreme care he took to keep his
head protected. But no tiles came. Bealby
had discovered a more dangerous attack developing
inside the house and was already in
retreat down the other side of the building.</p>

<p class='c011'>He did a leap that might have hurt him badly,
taking off from the corner of the house and
jumping a good twelve feet on to a big heap of
straw in the butcher’s yard. He came down on all
fours and felt a little jarred for an instant, and
then he was up again and had scrambled up by a
heap of manure to the top of the butcher’s wall.
He was over that and into Maccullum’s yard
next door before anyone in the front of the new
house had realized that he was in flight. Then one
of the two workmen who had been coming up
inside the house saw him from the oblong opening
that was some day to be the upstairs bedroom
window, and gave tongue.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was thirty seconds later, and after Bealby
had vanished from the butcher’s wall that the
foreman, still clinging to his hod, appeared over
the ridge of the roof. At the workman’s shout
the policeman, who with the preventive disposition
of his profession, had hitherto been stopping
anyone from coming into the unfinished house,
turned about and ran out into its brick and
plaster and timber-littered backyard, whereupon
the crowd in the street realizing that the quarry
had gone away and no longer restrained, came
pouring partly through the house and partly
round through the butcher’s gate into his yard.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby had had a check.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>He had relied upon the tarred felt roof of the
mushroom shed of Maccullum the tailor and
breeches-maker to get him to the wall that gave
upon Mr. Benshaw’s strawberry fields and he
had not seen from his roof above the ramshackle
glazed outhouse which Maccullum called his
workroom and in which four industrious tailors
were working in an easy dishabille. The roof of
the shed was the merest tarred touchwood, it
had perished as felt long ago, it collapsed under
Bealby, he went down into a confusion of mushrooms
and mushroom-bed, he blundered out
trailing mushrooms and spawn and rich matter,
he had a nine-foot wall to negotiate and only
escaped by a hair’s-breadth from the clutch of a
little red-slippered man who came dashing out
from the workroom. But by a happy use of the
top of the dustbin he did just get away over the
wall in time, and the red-slippered tailor, who
was not good at walls, was left struggling to imitate
an ascent that had looked easy enough until
he came to try it.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment the little tailor struggled alone
and then both Maccullum’s little domain and
the butcher’s yard next door and the little patch
of space behind the new house, were violently
injected with a crowd of active people, all confusedly
on the Bealby trail. Someone, he never
knew who, gave the little tailor a leg-up and then
his red slippers twinkled over the wall and he was
leading the hunt into the market gardens of Mr.
Benshaw. A collarless colleague in list slippers
and conspicuous braces followed. The policeman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>after he had completed the wreck of Mr. Maccullum’s
mushroom shed, came next, and then
Mr. Maccullum, with no sense of times and
seasons, anxious to have a discussion at once upon
the question of this damage. Mr. Maccullum
was out of breath and he never got further with
this projected conversation than “Here!” This
he repeated several times as opportunity seemed
to offer. The remaining tailors got to the top of
the wall more sedately with the help of the Maccullum
kitchen steps and dropped; Mr. Schocks
followed, breathing hard, and then a fresh jet of
humanity came squirting into the gardens through
a gap in the fence at the back of the building site.
This was led by the young workman who had
first seen Bealby go away. Hard behind him came
Rymell, the vet, the grocer’s assistant, the doctor’s
page-boy and, less briskly, the baker. Then the
tramp. Then Mumby and Schocks’s boy. Then
a number of other people. The seeking of Bealby
had assumed the dimensions of a Hue and Cry.</p>

<p class='c011'>The foreman with the large head and the
upright back was still on the new roof; he was
greatly distressed at the turn things had taken
and shouted his claims to a major share in the
capture of Bealby, mixed with his opinions of
Bealby and a good deal of mere swearing, to a
sunny but unsympathetic sky....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 3</h3>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Benshaw was a small holder, a sturdy
English yeoman of the new school. He was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>an Anti-Socialist, a self-helper, an independent-spirited
man. He had a steadily growing banking
account and a plain but sterile wife, and he was
dark in complexion and so erect in his bearing as
to seem a little to lean forward. Usually he
wore a sort of grey gamekeeper’s suit with brown
gaiters (except on Sundays when the coat was
black), he was addicted to bowler hats that accorded
ill with his large grave grey-coloured face,
and he was altogether a very sound strong man.
His bowler hats did but accentuate that. He
had no time for vanities, even the vanity of dressing
consistently. He went into the nearest shop
and just bought the cheapest hat he could, and
so he got hats designed for the youthful and
giddy, hats with flighty crowns and flippant
bows and amorous brims that undulated attractively
to set off flushed and foolish young faces.
It made his unrelenting face look rather like the
Puritans under the Stuart monarchy.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was a horticulturist rather than a farmer.
He had begun his career in cheap lodgings with a
field of early potatoes and cabbages, supplemented
by employment, but with increased
prosperity his area of cultivation had extended
and his methods intensified. He now grew considerable
quantities of strawberries, raspberries,
celery, seakale, asparagus, early peas, late peas,
and onions, and consumed more stable manure
than any other cultivator within ten miles of
Crayminster. He was beginning to send cut
flowers to London. He had half an acre of glass
and he was rapidly extending it. He had built
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>himself a cottage on lines of austere economy,
and a bony-looking dwelling house for some of
his men. He also owned a number of useful
sheds of which tar and corrugated iron were conspicuous
features. His home was furnished with
the utmost respectability, and notably joyless
even in a countryside where gaiety is regarded
as an impossible quality in furniture. He was
already in a small local way a mortgagee. Good
fortune had not turned the head of Mr. Benshaw
nor robbed him of the feeling that he was a
particularly deserving person, entitled to a preferential
treatment from a country which in his
plain unsparing way he felt that he enriched.</p>

<p class='c011'>In many ways he thought that the country was
careless of his needs. And in none more careless
than in the laws relating to trespass. Across his
dominions ran three footpaths, and one of these
led to the public elementary school. That he
should have to maintain this latter—and if he
did not keep it in good order the children spread
out and made parallel tracks among his cultivations—seemed
to him a thing almost intolerably
unjust. He mended it with cinders, acetylene
refuse, which he believed and hoped to be
thoroughly bad for boots, and a peculiarly slimy
chalky clay, and he put on a board at each end
“Keep to the footpaths, Trespassers will be
prosecuted, by Order,” which he painted himself
to save expense when he was confined indoors
by the influenza. Still more unjust it would be,
he felt, for him to spend money upon effective
fencing, and he could find no fencing cheap enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>and ugly enough and painful enough and impossible
enough to express his feelings in the
matter. Every day the children streamed to
and fro, marking how his fruits ripened and
his produce became more esculent. And other
people pursued these tracks; many, Mr. Benshaw
was convinced, went to and fro through his orderly
crops who had no business whatever, no honest
business, to pass that way. Either, he concluded,
they did it to annoy him, or they did it to injure
him. This continual invasion aroused in Mr.
Benshaw all that stern anger against unrighteousness
latent in our race which more than any other
single force has made America and the Empire
what they are to-day. Once already he had
been robbed—a raid upon his raspberries—and
he felt convinced that at any time he might
be robbed again. He had made representations
to the local authority to get the footpath closed,
but in vain. They defended themselves with the
paltry excuse that the children would then have
to go nearly a mile round to the school.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not only the tyranny of these footpaths
that offended Mr. Benshaw’s highly developed
sense of Individual Liberty. All round his rather
straggling dominions his neighbours displayed an
ungenerous indisposition to maintain their fences
to his satisfaction. In one or two places, in abandonment
of his clear rights in the matter, he had,
at his own expense, supplemented these lax defences
with light barbed wire defences. But it was
not a very satisfactory sort of barbed wire. He
wanted barbed wire with extra spurs like a fighting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>cock; he wanted barbed wire that would start
out after nightfall and attack passers-by. This
boundary trouble was universal; in a way it
was worse than the footpaths which after all
only affected the Cage Fields where his strawberries
grew. Except for the yard and garden
walls of Maccullum and Schocks and that side,
there was not really a satisfactory foot of enclosure
all round Mr. Benshaw. On the one side
rats and people’s dogs and scratching cats came
in, on the other side rabbits. The rabbits were
intolerable and recently there had been a rise of
nearly thirty per cent in the price of wire netting.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Benshaw wanted to hurt rabbits; he did
not want simply to kill them, he wanted so to kill
them as to put the fear of death into the burrows.
He wanted to kill them so that scared little furry
survivors with their tails as white as ghosts would
go lolloping home and say, “I say, you chaps,
we’d better shift out of this. We’re up against a
Strong Determined Man....”</p>

<p class='c011'>I have made this lengthy statement of Mr.
Benshaw’s economic and moral difficulties in
order that the reader should understand the
peculiar tension that already existed upon this
side of Crayminster. It has been necessary to
do so now because in a few seconds there will
be no further opportunity for such preparations.</p>

<p class='c011'>There had been trouble, I may add very hastily,
about the shooting of Mr. Benshaw’s gun; a
shower of small shot had fallen out of the twilight
upon the umbrella and basket of old Mrs. Frobisher.
And only a week ago an unsympathetic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>bench after a hearing of over an hour and in the
face of overwhelming evidence had refused to
convict little Lucy Mumby, aged eleven, of
stealing fruit from Mr. Benshaw’s fields. She
had been caught red-handed....</p>

<p class='c011'>At the very moment that Bealby was butting
the baker in the stomach, Mr. Benshaw was just
emerging from his austere cottage after a wholesome
but inexpensive high tea in which he had
finished up two left-over cold sausages, and he
was considering very deeply the financial side of
a furious black fence that he had at last decided
should pen in the school children from
further depredations. It should be of splintery
tarred deal, and high, with well-pointed tops
studded with sharp nails, and he believed that
by making the path only two feet wide, a real
saving of ground for cultivation might be made
and a very considerable discomfort for the public
arranged, to compensate for his initial expense.
The thought of a narrow lane which would in
winter be characterized by an excessive slimness
and from which there would be no lateral escape
was pleasing to a mind by no means absolutely
restricted to considerations of pounds, shillings
and pence. In his hand after his custom he carried
a hoe, on the handle of which feet were marked,
so that it was available not only for destroying
the casual weed but also for purposes of measurement.
With this he now checked his estimate and
found that here he would reclaim as much as three
feet of trodden waste, here a full two.</p>

<p class='c011'>Absorbed in these calculations, he heeded little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>the growth of a certain clamour from the backs
of the houses bordering on the High Street. It
did not appear to concern him and Mr. Benshaw
made it almost ostentatiously his rule to mind his
own business. His eyes remained fixed on the
lumpy, dusty, sunbaked track, that with an intelligent
foresight he saw already transformed into
a deterrent slough of despond for the young....</p>

<p class='c011'>Then quite suddenly the shouting took on a new
note. He glanced over his shoulder almost involuntarily
and discovered that after all this uproar
was his business. Amazingly his business.
His mouth assumed a Cromwellian fierceness.
His grip tightened on his hoe. That anyone
should dare! But it was impossible!</p>

<p class='c011'>His dominions were being invaded with a peculiar
boldness and violence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ahead of everyone else and running with wild
wavings of the arms across his strawberries was
a small and very dirty little boy. He impressed
Mr. Benshaw merely as a pioneer. Some thirty
yards behind him was a little collarless, short-sleeved
man in red slippers running with great
effrontery and behind him another still more
denuded lunatic, also in list slippers and with
braces—braces of inconceivable levity. And
then Wiggs, the policeman, hotly followed by Mr.
Maccullum. Then more distraught tailors and
Schocks the butcher. But a louder shout heralded
the main attack, and Mr. Benshaw turned his
eyes—already they were slightly blood-shot eyes—to
the right, and saw, pouring through the
broken hedge, a disorderly crowd, Rymell whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>he had counted his friend, the grocer’s assistant,
the doctor’s boy, some strangers—Mumby!</p>

<p class='c011'>At the sight of Mumby, Mr. Benshaw leapt at
a conclusion. He saw it all. The whole place
was rising against him; they were asserting some
infernal new right-of-way. Mumby—Mumby
had got them to do it. All the fruits of fifteen
years of toil, all the care and accumulation of Mr.
Benshaw’s prime, were to be trampled and torn
to please a draper’s spite!...</p>

<p class='c011'>Sturdy yeoman as Mr. Benshaw was he resolved
instantly to fight for his liberties. One moment
he paused to blow the powerful police whistle
he carried in his pocket and then rushed forward
in the direction of the hated Mumby, the leader
of trespassers, the parent and abetter and defender
of the criminal Lucy. He took the hurrying
panting man almost unawares, and with one
wild sweep of the hoe felled him to the earth.
Then he staggered about and smote again, but not
quite in time to get the head of Mr. Rymell.</p>

<p class='c011'>This whistle he carried was part of a systematic
campaign he had developed against trespassers
and fruit stealers. He and each of his assistants
carried one, and at the first shrill note—it was
his rule—everyone seized on every weapon
that was handy and ran to pursue and capture.
All his assistants were extraordinarily prompt
in responding to these alarms, which were often
the only break in long days of strenuous and
strenuously directed toil. So now with an astonishing
promptitude and animated faces men
appeared from sheds and greenhouses and distant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>patches of culture, hastening to the assistance of
their dour employer.</p>

<p class='c011'>It says much for the amiable relations that
existed between employers and employed in those
days before Syndicalism became the creed of
the younger workers that they did hurry to his
assistance.</p>

<p class='c011'>But many rapid things were to happen before
they came into action. For first a strange
excitement seized upon the tramp. A fantastic
delusive sense of social rehabilitation took possession
of his soul. Here he was pitted against
a formidable hoe-wielding man, who for some inscrutable
reason was resolved to cover the retreat
of Bealby. And all the world, it seemed,
was with the tramp and against this hoe-wielder.
All the tremendous forces of human society,
against which the tramp had struggled for
so many years, whose power he knew and
feared as only the outlaw can, had suddenly
come into line with him. Across the strawberries
to the right there was even a policeman hastening
to join the majority, a policeman closely followed
by a tradesman of the blackest, most respectable
quality. The tramp had a vision of himself as
a respectable man heroically leading respectable
people against outcasts. He dashed the
lank hair from his eyes, waved his arms laterally,
and then with a loud strange cry flung himself
towards Mr. Benshaw. Two pairs of superimposed
coat-tails flapped behind him. And
then the hoe whistled through the air and the
tramp fell to the ground like a sack.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>But now Schocks’s boy had grasped his opportunity.
He had been working discreetly round
behind Mr. Benshaw, and as the hoe smote he
leapt upon that hero’s back and seized him about
the neck with both arms and bore him staggering
to the ground, and Rymell, equally quick, and
used to the tackling of formidable creatures, had
snatched and twisted away the hoe and grappled
Mr. Benshaw almost before he was down. The
first of Mr. Benshaw’s helpers to reach the fray
found the issue decided, his master held down
conclusively and a growing circle trampling down
a wide area of strawberry plants about the panting
group....</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Mumby, more frightened than hurt, was
already sitting up, but the tramp with a glowing
wound upon his cheekbone and an expression of
astonishment in his face, lay low and pawed the
earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What d’you mean,” gasped Mr. Rymell,
“hitting people about with that hoe?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What d’you mean,” groaned Mr. Benshaw,
“running across my strawberries?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We were going after that boy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pounds and pounds’ worth of damage. Mischief
and wickedness.... Mumby!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Rymell, suddenly realizing the true values
of the situation, released Mr. Benshaw’s hands
and knelt up. “Look here, Mr. Benshaw,” he
said, “you seem to be under the impression we
are trespassing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Benshaw, struggling into a sitting position
was understood to enquire with some heat what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Mr. Rymell called it. Schocks’s boy picked up
the hat with the erotic brim and handed it to the
horticulturist silently and respectfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We were not trespassing,” said Mr. Rymell.
“We were following up that boy. <em>He</em> was trespassing,
if you like.... By the bye,—where
<em>is</em> the boy? Has anyone caught him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>At the question, attention which had been focussed
upon Mr. Benshaw and his hoe, came round.
Across the field in the direction of the sunlit
half acre of glass the little tailor was visible
standing gingerly and picking up his red slippers
for the third time—they would come off in that
loose good soil, everybody else had left the trail
to concentrate on Mr. Benshaw—and Bealby—.
Bealby was out of sight. He had escaped, clean
got away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What boy?” asked Mr. Benshaw.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ferocious little beast who’s fought us like a
rat. Been committing all sorts of crimes about
the country. Five pounds reward for him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fruit stealing?” asked Mr. Benshaw.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Mr. Rymell, chancing it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Benshaw reflected slowly. His eyes surveyed
his trampled crops. “Gooo <em>Lord</em>!”
he cried. “Look at those strawberries!” His
voice gathered violence. “And that lout there!”
he said. “Why!—he’s lying on them! That’s
the brute who went for me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You got him a pretty tidy one side the
head!” said Maccullum.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tramp rolled over on some fresh strawberries
and groaned pitifully.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>“He’s hurt,” said Mr. Mumby.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tramp flopped and lay still.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Get some water!” said Rymell, standing up.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the word water, the tramp started convulsively,
rolled over and sat up with a dazed expression.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No water,” he said weakly. “No more
water,” and then catching Mr. Benshaw’s eye
he got rather quickly to his feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everybody who wasn’t already standing was
getting up, and everyone now was rather carefully
getting himself off any strawberry plant he
had chanced to find himself smashing in the
excitement of the occasion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s the man that started in on me,” said
Mr. Benshaw. “What’s he doing here? Who
is he?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who are <em>you</em>, my man? What business have
you to be careering over this field?” asked Mr.
Rymell.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was only ’elping,” said the tramp.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nice help,” said Mr. Benshaw.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought that boy was a thief or something.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And so you made a rush at me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I didn’t exactly—sir—I thought you was
’elping ’im.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You be off, anyhow,” said Mr. Benshaw.
“Whatever you thought.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, you be off!” said Mr. Rymell.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s the way, my man,” said Mr. Benshaw.
“We haven’t any jobs for you. The sooner we
have you out of it the better for everyone. Get
right on to the path and keep it.” And with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>desolating sense of exclusion the tramp withdrew.
“There’s pounds and pounds’ worth of damage
here,” said Mr. Benshaw. “This job’ll cost me
a pretty penny. Look at them berries there.
Why, they ain’t fit for jam! And all done by
one confounded boy.” An evil light came into
Mr. Benshaw’s eyes. “You leave him to me and
my chaps. If he’s gone up among those sheds
there—we’ll settle with him. Anyhow there’s
no reason why my fruit should be trampled worse
than it has been. Fruit stealer, you say, he is?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They live on the country this time of year,”
said Mr. Mumby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And catch them doing a day’s work picking!”
said Mr. Benshaw. “I know the sort.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s a reward of five pounds for ’im already,”
said the baker....</p>

<p class='c010'>You perceive how humanitarian motives may
sometimes defeat their own end, and how little
Lady Laxton’s well-intentioned handbills were
serving to rescue Bealby. Instead, they were
turning him into a scared and hunted animal.
In spite of its manifest impossibility he was convinced
that the reward and this pursuit had to do
with his burglary of the poultry farm, and that
his capture would be but the preliminary to prison,
trial and sentence. His one remaining idea was
to get away. But his escape across the market
gardens had left him so blown and spent, that he
was obliged to hide up for a time in this perilous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>neighbourhood, before going on. He saw a disused-looking
shed in the lowest corner of the
gardens behind the greenhouses, and by doubling
sharply along a hedge he got to it unseen. It was
not disused—nothing in Mr. Benshaw’s possession
ever was absolutely disused, but it was filled
with horticultural lumber, with old calcium carbide
tins, with broken wheelbarrows and damaged
ladders awaiting repair, with some ragged wheeling
planks and surplus rolls of roofing felt. At
the back were some unhinged shed doors leaning
against the wall, and between them Bealby tucked
himself neatly and became still, glad of any
respite from the chase.</p>

<p class='c011'>He would wait for twilight and then get away
across the meadows at the back and then go—He
didn’t know whither. And now he had no
confidence in the wild world any more. A qualm
of home-sickness for the compact little gardener’s
cottage at Shonts, came to Bealby. Why, as a
matter of fact, wasn’t he there now?</p>

<p class='c011'>He ought to have tried more at Shonts.</p>

<p class='c011'>He ought to have minded what they told him
and not have taken up a toasting fork against
Thomas. Then he wouldn’t now have been a
hunted burglar with a reward of five pounds on
his head and nothing in his pocket but threepence
and a pack of greasy playing cards, a box of sulphur
matches and various objectionable sundries,
none of which were properly his own.</p>

<p class='c011'>If only he could have his time over again!</p>

<p class='c011'>Such wholesome reflections occupied his
thoughts until the onset of the dusk stirred him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>to departure. He crept out of his hiding-place
and stretched his limbs which had got very stiff,
and was on the point of reconnoitring from the
door of the shed when he became aware of stealthy
footsteps outside.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the quickness of an animal he shot back
into his hiding-place. The footsteps had halted.
For a long time it seemed the unseen waited,
listening. Had he heard Bealby?</p>

<p class='c011'>Then someone fumbled with the door of the
shed; it opened, and there was a long pause of
cautious inspection.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the unknown had shuffled into the shed
and sat down on a heap of matting.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Gaw!</em>” said a voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tramp’s!</p>

<p class='c011'>“If ever I struck a left-handed Mascot it was
that boy,” said the tramp. “The little <em>swine</em>!”</p>

<p class='c011'>For the better part of two minutes he went on
from this mild beginning to a descriptive elaboration
of Bealby. For the first time in his life
Bealby learnt how unfavourable was the impression
he might leave on a fellow creature’s mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Took even my matches!” cried the tramp,
and tried this statement over with variations.</p>

<p class='c011'>“First that old fool with his syringe!” The
tramp’s voice rose in angry protest. “Here’s a
chap dying epilepsy on your doorstep and all
you can do is to squirt cold water at him! Cold
water! Why you might <em>kill</em> a man doing that!
And then say you’d thought’d bring ’im ränd!
Bring ’im ränd! You be jolly glad I didn’t
stash your silly face in. You [misbegotten] old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>fool! What’s a shilling for wetting a man to ’is
skin. Wet through I was. Running inside my
shirt,—dripping.... And then the blooming
boy clears!</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>I</em> don’t know what boys are coming to!”
cried the tramp. “These board schools it is.
Gets ’old of everything ’e can and bunks! Gaw!
if I get my ’ands on ’im, I’ll show ’im. I’ll—”</p>

<p class='c011'>For some time the tramp revelled in the details,
for the most part crudely surgical, of his vengeance
upon Bealby....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then there’s that dog bite. ’Ow do I know
’ow that’s going to turn ät? If I get ’idrophobia,
blowed if I don’t <em>bite</em> some of ’em. ’Idrophobia.
Screaming and foaming. Nice death for a man—my
time o’ life! Bark I shall. Bark and bite.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And this is your world,” said the tramp.
“This is the world you put people into and expect
’em to be ’appy....</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d like to bite that dough-faced fool with the
silly ’at. I’d enjoy biting <em>’im</em>. I’d spit it out
but I’d bite it right enough. Wiping abät with
’is <em>’O. Gaw!</em> Get off my ground! Be orf with
you. Slash. ’E ought to be shut up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where’s the justice of it?” shouted the tramp.
“Where’s the right and the sense of it? What
’ave <em>I</em> done that I should always get the under
side? Why should <em>I</em> be stuck on the under side
of everything? There’s worse men than me in
all sorts of positions.... Judges there are.
’Orrible Kerecters. Ministers and people. I’ve
read abät ’em in the papers....</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s we tramps are the scapegoats. Somebody’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>got to suffer so as the police can show a
face. Gaw! Some of these days I’ll do something.
I’ll do something. You’ll drive me too
far with it, I tell you—”</p>

<p class='c011'>He stopped suddenly and listened. Bealby
had creaked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gaw! What can one do?” said the tramp
after a long interval.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then complaining more gently, the tramp
began to feel about to make his simple preparations
for the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Unt me out of this, I expect,” said the tramp.
“And many sleeping in feather beds that ain’t fit
to ’old a candle to me. Not a hordinary farthing
candle....”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 5</h3>

<p class='c010'>The subsequent hour or so was an interval of
tedious tension for Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>After vast spaces of time he was suddenly
aware of three vertical threads of light. He
stared at them with mysterious awe, until he
realized that they were just the moonshine
streaming through the cracks of the shed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tramp tossed and muttered in his sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>Footsteps?</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes—Footsteps.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then voices.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were coming along by the edge of the
field, and coming and talking very discreetly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ugh!” said the tramp, and then softly,
“what’s that?” Then he too became noiselessly
attentive.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Bealby could hear his own heart beating.</p>

<p class='c011'>The men were now close outside the shed.
“He wouldn’t go in there,” said Mr. Benshaw’s
voice. “He wouldn’t dare. Anyhow we’ll go
up by the glass first. I’ll let him have the whole
barrelful of oats if I get a glimpse of him. If
he’d gone away they’d have caught him in the
road....”</p>

<p class='c011'>The footsteps receded. There came a cautious
rustling on the part of the tramp and then his
feet padded softly to the door of the shed. He
struggled to open it and then with a jerk got
it open a few inches; a great bar of moonlight
leapt and lay still across the floor of the shed.
Bealby advanced his head cautiously until he
could see the black obscure indications of the
tramp’s back as he peeped out.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Now</em>,” whispered the tramp and opened the
door wider. Then he ducked his head down and
darted out of sight, leaving the door open behind
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby questioned whether he should follow.
He came out a few steps and then went back at
a shout from away up the garden. “There he
goes,” shouted a voice, “in the shadow of the
hedge.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look out, Jim!”—<em>Bang</em>—and a yelp.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stand away! I’ve got another barrel!”</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Bang.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>Then silence for a time, and then the footsteps
coming back.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That ought to teach him,” said Mr. Benshaw.
“First time, I got him fair, and I think I peppered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>him a bit the second. Couldn’t see very well,
but I heard him yell. He won’t forget that in a
hurry. Not him. There’s nothing like oats
for fruit stealers. Jim, just shut that door,
will you? That’s where he was hiding....”</p>

<p class='c011'>It seemed a vast time to Bealby before he
ventured out into the summer moonlight, and a
very pitiful and outcast little Bealby he felt himself
to be.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was beginning to realize what it means to
go beyond the narrow securities of human society.
He had no friends, no friends at all....</p>

<p class='c011'>He caught at and arrested a sob of self-pity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps after all it was not so late as Bealby
had supposed. There were still lights in some of
the houses and he had the privilege of seeing Mr.
Benshaw going to bed with pensive deliberation.
Mr. Benshaw wore a flannel night-shirt and said
quite a lengthy prayer before extinguishing his
candle. Then suddenly Bealby turned nervously
and made off through the hedge. A dog
had barked.</p>

<p class='c011'>At first there were nearly a dozen lighted
windows in Crayminster. They went out one
by one. He hung for a long time with a passionate
earnestness on the sole surviving one, but that
too went at last. He could have wept when at
last it winked out. He came down into the marshy
flats by the river, but he did not like the way
in which the water sucked and swirled in the
vague moonlight; also he suddenly discovered
a great white horse standing quite still in the
misty grass not thirty yards away; so he went up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>to and crossed the high road and wandered up
the hillside towards the allotments, which attracted
him by reason of the sociability of the
numerous tool sheds. In a hedge near at hand
a young rabbit squealed sharply and was stilled.
Why?</p>

<p class='c011'>Then something like a short snake scrabbled by
very fast through the grass.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he thought he saw the tramp stalking
him noiselessly behind some currant bushes.
That went on for some time, but came to nothing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then nothing pursued him, nothing at all.
The gap, the void, came after him. The bodiless,
the faceless, the formless; these are evil hunters
in the night....</p>

<p class='c011'>What a cold still <em>watching</em> thing moonlight can
be!...</p>

<p class='c011'>He thought he would like to get his back
against something solid, and found near one of
the sheds a little heap of litter. He sat down
against good tarred boards, assured at least
that whatever came must come in front. Whatever
he did, he was resolved, he would not shut
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>That would be fatal....</p>

<p class='c011'>He awoke in broad daylight amidst a cheerful
uproar of birds.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 6</h3>

<p class='c010'>And then again flight and pursuit were resumed.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Bealby went up the hill away from Crayminster
he saw a man standing over a spade and
watching his retreat and when he looked back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>again presently this man was following. It was
Lady Laxton’s five pound reward had done the
thing for him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was half minded to surrender and have done
with it, but jail he knew was a dreadful thing
of stone and darkness. He would make one last
effort. So he beat along the edge of a plantation
and then crossed it and forced his way through
some gorse and came upon a sunken road, that
crossed the hill in a gorse-lined cutting. He
struggled down the steep bank. At its foot, regardless
of him, unaware of him, a man sat beside
a motor bicycle with his fists gripped tight and
his head downcast, swearing. A county map
was crumpled in his hand. “Damn!” he cried,
and flung the map to the ground and kicked it
and put his foot on it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bealby slipped, came down the bank with a run
and found himself in the road within a couple
of yards of the blond features and angry eyes of
Captain Douglas. When he saw the Captain and
perceived himself recognized, he flopped down—a
done and finished Bealby....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 7</h3>

<p class='c010'>He had arrived just in time to interrupt the
Captain in a wild and reprehensible fit of passion.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Captain imagined it was a secret fit of passion.
He thought he was quite alone and that
no one could hear him or see him. So he had let
himself shout and stamp, to work off the nervous
tensions that tormented him beyond endurance.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>In the direst sense of the words the Captain was
in love with Madeleine. He was in love quite
beyond the bounds set by refined and decorous
people to this dangerous passion. The primordial
savage that lurks in so many of us was
uppermost in him. He was not in love with her
prettily or delicately, he was in love with her
violently and vehemently. He wanted to be
with her, he wanted to be close to her, he wanted
to possess her and nobody else to approach her.
He was so inflamed now that no other interest
in life had any importance except as it aided or
interfered with this desire. He had forced himself
in spite of this fever in his blood to leave
her to pursue Bealby, and now he was regretting
this firmness furiously. He had expected to
catch Bealby overnight and bring him back to
the hotel in triumph. But Bealby had been
elusive. There she was, away there, hurt and
indignant—neglected!</p>

<p class='c011'>“A laggard in love,” cried the Captain, “a
dastard in war! God!—I run away from everything.
First I leave the manœuvres, then her.
Unstable as water thou shalt not prevail. Water!
What does the confounded boy matter? What
does he matter?</p>

<p class='c011'>“And there she is. Alone! She’ll flirt—naturally
she’ll flirt. Don’t I deserve it?
Haven’t I asked for it? Just the one little time
we might have had together! I fling it in her
face. You fool, you laggard, you dastard! And
here’s this map!”</p>

<p class='c011'>A breathing moment.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>“How the <em>devil</em>,” cried the Captain, “am I to
find the little beast on this map?</p>

<p class='c011'>“And twice he’s been within reach of my hand!</p>

<p class='c011'>“No decision!” cried the Captain. “No instant
grip! What good is a soldier without it?
What good is any man who will not leap at
opportunity? I ought to have chased out last
night after that fool and his oats. Then I might
have had a chance!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Chuck it! Chuck the whole thing! Go
back to her. Kneel to her, kiss her, compel her!</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what sort of reception am I likely to
get?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He crumpled the flapping map in his fist.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then suddenly out of nowhere Bealby
came rolling down to his feet, a dishevelled and
earthy Bealby. But Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good Lord!” cried the Captain, starting to
his feet and holding the map like a sword sheath.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you want?”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a second Bealby was a silent spectacle of
misery.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oooh! I want my <em>breckfuss</em>,” he burst out
at last, reduced to tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you young Bealby?” asked the Captain,
seizing him by the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They’re after me,” cried Bealby. “If they
catch me they’ll put me in prison. Where they
don’t give you anything. It wasn’t me did it—and
I ’aven’t had anything to eat—not since
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Captain came rapidly to a decision. There
should be no more faltering. He saw his way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>clear before him. He would act—like a whistling
sword. “Here! jump up behind,” he said
... “hold on tight to me....”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 8</h3>

<p class='c010'>For a time there was a more than Napoleonic
swiftness in the Captain’s movements. When
Bealby’s pursuer came up to the hedge that looks
down into the sunken road, there was no Bealby,
no Captain, nothing but a torn and dishevelled
county map, an almost imperceptible odour of
petrol and a faint sound—like a distant mowing
machine—and the motor bicycle was a mile
away on the road to Beckinstone. Eight miles,
eight rather sickening miles, Bealby did to Beckinstone
in eleven minutes, and there in a little
coffee house he was given breakfast with eggs
and bacon and marmalade (Prime!), and his
spirit was restored to him while the Captain
raided a bicycle and repairing shop and negotiated
the hire of an experienced but fairly comfortable
wickerwork trailer. And so, to London
through the morning sunshine, leaving tramps,
pursuers, policemen, handbills, bakers, market
gardeners, terrors of the darkness and everything
upon the road behind—and further behind and
remote and insignificant—and so to the vanishing
point.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some few words of explanation the Captain
had vouchsafed, and that was all.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t be afraid about it,” he said. “Don’t
be in the least bit afraid. You tell them about it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>just simply and truthfully, exactly what you did,
exactly how you got into it and out of it and all
about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’re going to take me up to a Magistrate,
sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m going to take you up to the Lord Chancellor
himself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And then they won’t do anything?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing at all, Bealby; you trust me. All
you’ve got to do is to tell the simple truth....”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was pretty rough going in the trailer, but very
exciting. If you gripped the sides very hard, and
sat quite tight, nothing very much happened and
also there was a strap across your chest. And
you went past everything. There wasn’t a thing
on the road the Captain didn’t pass, lowing deeply
with his great horn when they seemed likely to
block his passage. And as for the burglary and
everything, it would all be settled....</p>

<p class='c011'>The Captain also found that ride to London
exhilarating. At least he was no longer hanging
about; he was getting to something. He would
be able to go back to her—and all his being now
yearned to go back to her—with things achieved,
with successes to show. He’d found the boy.
He would go straight to dear old uncle Chickney,
and uncle Chickney would put things right with
Moggeridge, the boy would bear his testimony,
Moggeridge would be convinced and all would be
well again. He might be back with Madeleine
that evening. He would go back to her, and she
would see the wisdom and energy of all he had
done, and she would lift that dear chin of hers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>smile that dear smile of hers and hold out her
hand to be kissed and the lights and reflections
would play on that strong soft neck of hers....</p>

<p class='c011'>They buzzed along stretches of common and
stretches of straight-edged meadowland, by woods
and orchards, by pleasant inns and slumbering
villages and the gates and lodges of country houses.</p>

<p class='c011'>These latter grew more numerous, and presently
they skirted a town, and then more road, more
villages and at last signs of a nearness to London,
more frequent houses, more frequent inns, hoardings
and advertisements, an asphalted sidewalk,
lamps, a gasworks, laundries, a stretch of suburban
villadom, a suburban railway station, a suburbanized
old town, an omnibus, the head of a tramline,
a stretch of public common thick with noticeboards,
a broad pavement, something-or-other
parade, with a row of shops....</p>

<p class='c011'>London.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <span class='large'>HOW BEALBY EXPLAINED</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 1</h3>

<p class='c010'>Lord Chickney was only slightly older than
Lord Moggeridge, but he had not worn nearly so
well. His hearing was not good, though he would
never admit it, and the loss of several teeth
greatly affected his articulation. One might
generalize and say that neither physically nor
mentally do soldiers wear so well as lawyers.
The army ages men sooner than the law and philosophy;
it exposes them more freely to germs,
which undermine and destroy, and it shelters
them more completely from thought, which
stimulates and preserves. A lawyer must keep
his law highly polished and up-to-date or he hears
of it within a fortnight, a general never realizes
he is out of training and behind the times until
disaster is accomplished. Since the magnificent
retreat from Bondy-Satina in eighty-seven and
his five weeks defence of Barrowgast (with the
subsequent operations) the abilities of Lord
Chickney had never been exercised seriously
at all. But there was a certain simplicity of
manner and a tall drooping grizzled old-veteran
picturesqueness about him that kept him distinguished;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>he was easy to recognize on public
occasions on account of his long moustaches,
and so he got pointed out when greater men were
ignored. The autograph collectors adored him.
Every morning he would spend half an hour
writing autographs, and the habit was so strong
in him that on Sundays, when there was no London
post and autograph writing would have been
wrong anyhow, he filled the time in copying out
the epistle and gospel for the day. And he liked to
be well in the foreground of public affairs—if
possible wearing his decorations. After the autographs
he would work, sometimes for hours, for
various patriotic societies and more particularly
for those which would impose compulsory
training upon every man, woman and child in
the country. He even belonged to a society for
drilling the butchers’ ponies and training big
dogs as scouts. He did not understand how a
country could be happy unless every city was
fortified and every citizen wore side-arms, and
the slightest error in his dietary led to the most
hideous nightmares of the Channel Tunnel or
reduced estimates and a land enslaved. He
wrote and toiled for these societies, but he could
not speak for them on account of his teeth. For
he had one peculiar weakness; he had faced
death in many forms but he had never faced a
dentist. The thought of dentists gave him just
the same sick horror as the thought of invasion.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was a man of blameless private life, a
widower and childless. In later years he had
come to believe that he had once been very deeply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>in love with his cousin, Susan, who had married
a rather careless husband named Douglas; both
she and Douglas were dead now, but he maintained
a touching affection for her two lively
rather than satisfying sons. He called them
his nephews, and by the continuous attrition of
affection he had become their recognized uncle. He
was glad when they came to him in their scrapes,
and he liked to be seen about with them in public
places. They regarded him with considerable
confidence and respect and an affection that they
sometimes blamed themselves for as not quite
warm enough for his merits. But there is a
kind of injustice about affection.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was really gratified when he got a wire
from the less discreditable of these two bright
young relations, saying, “Sorely in need of your
advice. Hope to bring difficulties to you to-day
at twelve.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He concluded very naturally that the boy had
come to some crisis in his unfortunate entanglement
with Madeleine Philips, and he was flattered
by the trustfulness that brought the matter to
him. He resolved to be delicate but wily, honourable,
strictly honourable, but steadily, patiently
separative. He paced his spacious study with
his usual morning’s work neglected, and rehearsed
little sentences in his mind that might be effective
in the approaching interview. There would probably
be emotion. He would pat the lad on his
shoulder and be himself a little emotional. “I
understand, my boy,” he would say, “I understand.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>“Don’t forget, my boy, that I’ve been a young
man too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He would be emotional, he would be sympathetic,
but also he must be a man of the world.
“Sort of thing that won’t do, you know, my boy;
sort of thing that people will <em>not</em> stand.... A
soldier’s wife has to be a soldier’s wife and nothing
else.... Your business is to serve the king,
not—not some celebrity. Lovely, no doubt.
I don’t deny the charm of her—but on the
hoardings, my boy.... Now don’t you think—don’t
you <em>think</em>?—there’s some nice pure
girl somewhere, sweet as violets, new as the dawn,
and ready to be <em>yours</em>; a girl, I mean, a maiden
fancy free, not—how shall I put it?—a woman
of the world. Wonderful, I admit—but seasoned.
Public. My dear, dear boy, I knew your mother
when she was a girl, a sweet pure girl—a thing of
dewy freshness. Ah! Well I remember her!
All these years, my boy—Nothing. It’s difficult....”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tears stood in his brave old blue eyes as he
elaborated such phrases. He went up and down
mumbling them through the defective teeth and
the long moustache and waving an eloquent
hand.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 2</h3>

<p class='c010'>When Lord Chickney’s thoughts had once
started in any direction it was difficult to turn
them aside. No doubt that concealed and repudiated
deafness helped his natural perplexity
of mind. Truth comes to some of us as a still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>small voice, but Lord Chickney needed shouting
and prods. And Douglas did not get to him
until he was finishing lunch. Moreover, it was
the weakness of Captain Douglas to talk in
jerky fragments and undertones, rather than
clearly and fully in the American fashion. “Tell
me all about it, my boy,” said Lord Chickney.
“Tell me all about it. Don’t apologize
for your clothes. I understand. Motor bicycle
and just come up. But have you had any lunch,
Eric?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alan, uncle,—not Eric. My brother is Eric.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I called him Alan. Tell me all about
it. Tell me what has happened. What are you
thinking of doing? Just put the positions before
me. To tell you the truth I’ve been worrying
over this business for some time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Didn’t know you’d heard of it, uncle. He
can’t have talked about it already. Anyhow,—you
see all the awkwardness of the situation.
They say the old chap’s a thundering spiteful
old devil when he’s roused—and there’s no
doubt he was roused.... Tremendously....”</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Chickney was not listening very attentively.
Indeed he was also talking. “Not clear
to me there was another man in it,” he was saying.
“That makes it more complicated, my boy, makes
the row acuter. Old fellow, eh? Who?”</p>

<p class='c011'>They came to a pause at the same moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You speak so indistinctly,” complained Lord
Chickney. “<em>Who</em> did you say?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought you understood. Lord Moggeridge.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“Lord—! Lord Moggeridge! My dear Boy!
But how?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought you understood, uncle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He doesn’t want to marry her! Tut! Never!
Why, the man must be sixty if he’s a day....”</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Douglas regarded his distinguished
uncle for a moment with distressed eyes. Then he
came nearer, raised his voice and spoke more
deliberately.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know whether you quite understand,
uncle. I am talking about this affair at Shonts
last week-end.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear boy, there’s no need for you to
shout. If only you don’t mumble and clip your
words—and turn head over heels with your ideas.
Just tell me about it plainly. Who is Shonts?
One of those Liberal peers? I seem to have
heard the name....”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shonts, uncle, is the house the Laxtons have;
you know,—Lucy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little Lucy! I remember her. Curls all
down her back. Married the milkman. But
how does <em>she</em> come in, Alan? The story’s getting—complicated.
But that’s the worst of these
infernal affairs,—they always do get complicated.
Tangled skeins—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Oh what a tangled web we weave,</div>
      <div class='line'>When first we venture to deceive.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“And now, like a sensible man, you want to
get out of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Douglas was bright pink with the
effort to control himself and keep perfectly plain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>and straightforward. His hair had become like
tow and little beads of perspiration stood upon
his forehead.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I spent last week-end at Shonts,” he said.
“Lord Moggeridge, also there, week-ending. Got
it into his head that I was pulling his leg.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Naturally, my boy, if he goes philandering.
At his time of life. What else can he expect?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It wasn’t philandering.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fine distinctions. Fine distinctions. Go on—anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He got it into his head that I was playing
practical jokes upon him. Confused me with
Eric. It led to a rather first-class row. I had
to get out of the house. Nothing else to do. He
brought all sorts of accusations—”</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Douglas stopped short. His uncle
was no longer attending to him. They had
drifted to the window of the study and the general
was staring with an excitement and intelligence
that grew visibly at the spectacle of Bealby and
the trailer outside. For Bealby had been left
in the trailer, and he was sitting as good as gold
waiting for the next step in his vindication from
the dark charge of burglary. He was very travel-worn
and the trailer was time-worn as well as
travel-worn, and both contrasted with the efficient
neatness and newness of the motor bicycle in
front. The contrast had attracted the attention
of a tall policeman who was standing in a state
of elucidatory meditation regarding Bealby.
Bealby was not regarding the policeman. He
had the utmost confidence in Captain Douglas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>he felt sure that he would presently be purged of
all the horror of that dead old man and of the
brief unpremeditated plunge into crime, but still
for the present at any rate he did not feel equal to
staring a policeman out of countenance....</p>

<p class='c011'>From the window the policeman very largely
obscured Bealby....</p>

<p class='c011'>Whenever hearts are simple there lurks romance.
Age cannot wither nor custom stale her infinite
diversity. Suddenly out of your low kindly
diplomacies, your sane man-of-the-world intentions,
leaps the imagination like a rocket, flying
from such safe securities bang into the sky. So
it happened to the old general. He became
deaf to everything but the appearances before
him. The world was jewelled with dazzling and
delightful possibilities. His face was lit by a
glow of genuine romantic excitement. He grasped
his nephew’s arm. He pointed. His grizzled
cheeks flushed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That isn’t,” he asked with something verging
upon admiration in his voice and manner, “a
Certain Lady in disguise?”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 3</h3>

<p class='c010'>It became clear to Captain Douglas that if
ever he was to get to Lord Moggeridge that day
he must take his uncle firmly in hand. Without
even attempting not to appear to shout he cried,
“That is a little Boy. That is my Witness. It
is Most Important that I should get him to Lord
Moggeridge to tell his Story.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“What story?” cried the old commander,
pulling at his moustache and still eyeing Bealby
suspiciously....</p>

<p class='c011'>It took exactly half an hour to get Lord Chickney
from that enquiry to the telephone and even
then he was still far from clear about the matter
in hand. Captain Douglas got in most of the
facts, but he could not eliminate an idea that it
all had to do with Madeleine. Whenever he
tried to say clearly that she was entirely outside
the question, the general patted his shoulder and
looked very wise and kind and said, “My dear
Boy, I quite understand; I <em>quite</em> understand.
Never mention a lady. <em>No.</em>”</p>

<p class='c011'>So they started at last rather foggily—so far
as things of the mind went, though the sun that
day was brilliant—and because of engine trouble
in Port Street the general’s hansom reached
Tenby Little Street first and he got in a good
five minutes preparing the Lord Chancellor tactfully
and carefully before the bicycle and its
trailer came upon the scene....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 4</h3>

<p class='c010'>Candler had been packing that morning with
unusual solicitude for a week-end at Tulliver
Abbey. His master had returned from the catastrophe
of Shonts, fatigued and visibly aged and
extraordinarily cross, and Candler looked to
Tulliver Abbey to restore him to his former self.
Nothing must be forgotten; there must be no
little hitches, everything from first to last must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>go on oiled wheels, or it was clear his Lordship
might develop a desperate hostility to these
excursions, excursions which Candler found singularly
refreshing and entertaining during the
stresses of the session. Tulliver Abbey was as
good a house as Shonts was bad; Lady Checksammington
ruled with the softness of velvet
and the strength of steel over a household of
admirably efficient domestics, and there would
be the best of people there, Mr. Evesham perhaps,
the Loopers, Lady Privet, Andreas Doria and
Mr. Pernambuco, great silken mellow personages
and diamond-like individualities, amidst whom
Lord Moggeridge’s mind would be restfully active
and his comfort quite secure. And as far as
possible Candler wanted to get the books and
papers his master needed into the trunk or the
small valise. That habit of catching up everything
at the last moment and putting it under
his arm and the consequent need for alert picking
up, meant friction and nervous wear and tear
for both master and man.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Moggeridge rose at half-past ten—he
had been kept late overnight by a heated discussion
at the Aristotelian—and breakfasted lightly
upon a chop and coffee. Then something ruffled
him; something that came with the letters.
Candler could not quite make out what it was,
but he suspected another pamphlet by Dr. Schiller.
It could not be the chop, because Lord Moggeridge
was always wonderfully successful with chops.
Candler looked through the envelopes and letters
afterwards and found nothing diagnostic, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>then he observed a copy of <em>Mind</em> torn across and
lying in the waste-paper basket.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When I went out of the room,” said Candler,
discreetly examining this. “Very likely it’s that
there Schiller after all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But in this Candler was mistaken. What had
disturbed the Lord Chancellor was a coarsely
disrespectful article on the Absolute by a Cambridge
Rhodes scholar, written in that flighty
facetious strain that spreads now like a pestilence
over modern philosophical discussion. “Does the
Absolute, on Lord Moggeridge’s own showing,
mean anything more than an eloquent oiliness
uniformly distributed through space?” and so on.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pretty bad!</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Moggeridge early in life had deliberately
acquired a quite exceptional power of mental
self-control. He took his perturbed mind now
and threw it forcibly into the consideration of a
case upon which he had reserved judgment. He
was to catch the 3.35 at Paddington, and at two
he was smoking a cigar after a temperate lunch
and reading over the notes of this judgment.
It was then that the telephone bell became audible,
and Candler came in to inform him that Lord
Chickney was anxious to see him at once upon a
matter of some slight importance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Slight importance?” asked Lord Moggeridge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some slight importance, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some? Slight?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Is Lordship, my lord, mumbles rather now
’is back teeth ’ave gone,” said Candler, “but so
I understand ’im.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>“These apologetic assertive phrases annoy me,
Candler,” said Lord Moggeridge over his shoulder.
“You see,” he turned round and spoke very
clearly, “either the matter is of importance or
it is not of importance. A thing must either be
or not be. I wish you would manage—when
you get messages on the telephone—....  But
I suppose that is asking too much.... Will
you explain to him, Candler, when we start,
and—ask him, Candler—ask him what sort of
matter it is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Candler returned after some parleying.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So far as I can make ’is Lordship out, my
lord, ’e says ’e wants to set you right about
something, my lord. He says something about
a <em>little</em> misapprehension.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“These diminutives, Candler, kill sense. Does
he say what sort—what sort—of <em>little</em> misapprehension?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He says something—I’m sorry, my lord,
but it’s about Shonts, me lord.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I don’t want to hear about it,” said
Lord Moggeridge.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a pause. The Lord Chancellor
resumed his reading with a deliberate obviousness;
the butler hovered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m sorry, my lord, but I can’t think exactly
what I ought to say to ’is lordship, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell him—tell him that I do not wish to
hear anything more about Shonts for ever.
Simply.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Candler hesitated and went out, shutting the
door carefully lest any fragment of his halting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>rendering of this message to Lord Chickney
should reach his master’s ears.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Moggeridge’s powers of mental control
were, I say, very great—He could dismiss
subjects from his mind absolutely. In a few
instants he had completely forgotten Shonts and
was making notes with a silver-cased pencil on
the margins of his draft judgment.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 5</h3>

<p class='c010'>He became aware that Candler had returned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Is lordship, Lord Chickney, my lord, is very
persistent, my lord. ’E’s rung up twice. ’E says
now that ’e makes a personal matter of it. Come
what may, ’e says, ’e wishes to speak for two
minutes to your lordship. Over the telephone,
my lord, ’e vouchsafes no further information.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Moggeridge meditated over the end of
his third after lunch cigar. His man watched
the end of his left eyebrow as an engineer might
watch a steam gauge. There were no signs of
an explosion. “He must come, Candler,” his
lordship said at last....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Candler!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My lord?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Put the bags and things in a conspicuous
position in the hall, Candler. Change yourself,
and see that you look thoroughly like trains.
And in fact have everything ready, <em>prominently</em>
ready, Candler.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then once more Lord Moggeridge concentrated
his mind.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>
  <div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 6</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>To him there presently entered Lord Chickney.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Chickney had been twice round the world
and he had seen many strange and dusky peoples
and many remarkable customs and peculiar prejudices,
which he had never failed to despise, but he
had never completely shaken off the county family
ideas in which he had been brought up. He
believed that there was an incurable difference
in spirit between quite good people like himself
and men from down below like Moggeridge, who
was the son of an Exeter chorister. He believed
that these men from nowhere always cherished
the profoundest respect for the real thing like
himself, that they were greedy for association and
gratified by notice, and so for the life of him he
could not approach Lord Moggeridge without a
faint sense of condescension. He saluted him as
“my <em>dear</em> Lord Moggeridge,” wrung his hand
with effusion, and asked him kind, almost district-visiting,
questions about his younger brother
and the aspect of his house. “And you are just
off, I see, for a week-end.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These amenities the Lord Chancellor acknowledged
by faint gruntings and an almost imperceptible
movement of his eyebrows. “There was
a matter,” he said, “some <em>little</em> matter, on which
you want to consult me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” said Lord Chickney, and rubbed his
chin. “<em>Yes.</em> Yes, there <em>was</em> a little matter, a
little trouble—”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>“Of an urgent nature.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. Yes. Exactly. Just a little complicated,
you know, not quite simple.” The dear
old soldier’s manner became almost seductive.
“One of these difficult little affairs, where one
has to remember that one is a man of the world,
you know. A little complication about a lady,
known to you both. But one must make concessions,
one must understand. The boy has a
witness. Things are not as you supposed them
to be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Moggeridge had a clean conscience about
ladies; he drew out his watch and looked at it—aggressively.
He kept it in his hand during his
subsequent remarks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must confess,” he declared, “I have not
the remotest idea.... If you will be so good
as to be—elementary. What <em>is</em> it all about?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You see, I knew the lad’s mother,” said Lord
Chickney. “In fact—” He became insanely
confidential—“Under happier circumstances—don’t
misunderstand me, Moggeridge; I mean no
evil—but he might have been my son. I feel
for him like a son....”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 7</h3>

<p class='c010'>When presently Captain Douglas, a little
heated from his engine trouble, came into the
room—he had left Bealby with Candler in the
hall—it was instantly manifest to him that the
work of preparation had been inadequately performed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>“One minute more, my dear Alan,” cried Lord
Chickney.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Moggeridge with eyebrows waving and
watch in hand was of a different opinion. He
addressed himself to Captain Douglas.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There <em>isn’t</em> a minute more,” he said. “What
is all this—this philoprogenitive rigmarole about?
Why have you come to me? My cab is outside
<em>now</em>. All this about ladies and witnesses;—what
<em>is</em> it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perfectly simple, my lord! You imagine
that I played practical jokes upon you at Shonts.
I didn’t. I have a witness. The attack upon
you downstairs, the noise in your room—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have I any guarantee—?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s the steward’s boy from Shonts. Your
man outside knows him. Saw him in the steward’s
room. He made the trouble for you—and
me, and then he ran away. Just caught
him. Not exchanged thirty words with him.
Half a dozen questions. Settle everything.
Then you’ll know—nothing for you but the
utmost respect.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Moggeridge pressed his lips together and
resisted conviction.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In consideration,” interpolated Lord Chickney,
“feelings of an old fellow. Old soldier.
Boy means no harm.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With the rudeness of one sorely tried the Lord
Chancellor thrust the old general aside. “Oh!”
he said, “Oh!” and then to Captain Douglas.
“One minute. Where’s your witness?...”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Captain opened a door. Bealby found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>himself bundled into the presence of two celebrated
men.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell him,” said Captain Douglas. “And
look sharp about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me plainly,” cried the Lord Chancellor,
“and be—<em>quick</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He put such a point on “quick” that it made
Bealby jump.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell him,” said the general more gently.
“Don’t be afraid.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” began Bealby after one accumulating
pause, “it was ’im told me to do it. ’E said you
go in there—”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Captain would have interrupted but the
Lord Chancellor restrained him by a magnificent
gesture of the hand holding the watch.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He told you to do it!” he said. “I knew he
did. Now listen! He told you practically to
go in and do anything you could.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yessir.” Woe took possession of Bealby.
“I didn’t do any ’arm to the ole gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But <em>who</em> told you?” cried the Captain. “<em>Who</em>
told you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Moggeridge annihilated him with arm
and eyebrows. He held Bealby fascinated by a
pointing finger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t do more than answer the questions. I
have thirty seconds more. He told you to go in.
He <em>made</em> you go in. At the earliest possible
opportunity you got away?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I jest nipped out—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Enough! And now, sir, how dare you come
here without even a plausible lie? How dare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>you after your intolerable tomfoolery at Shonts
confront me again with fresh tomfoolery? How
dare you drag in your gallant and venerable
uncle in this last preposterous—I suppose you
would call it—<em>lark</em>! I suppose you had prepared
that little wretch with some fine story. Little
you know of False Witness! At the first question,
he breaks down! He does not even begin
his lie. He at least knows the difference between
my standards and yours. Candler! Candler!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Candler appeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These—these <em>gentlemen</em> are going. Is everything
ready?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The cab is at the door, m’lord. The usual
cab.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Douglas made one last desperate
effort. “Sir!” he said. “My lord—”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Lord Chancellor turned upon him with a
face that he sought to keep calm, though the eyebrows
waved and streamed like black smoke in a
gale. “Captain Douglas,” he said, “you are
probably not aware of the demands upon the
time and patience of a public servant in such a
position as mine. You see the world no doubt
as a vastly entertaining fabric upon which you
can embroider your—your facetious arrangements.
Well, it is not so. It is real. It is
earnest. You may sneer at the simplicity of an
old man, but what I tell you of life is true. Comic
effect is not, believe me, its goal. And you, sir,
you, sir, you impress me as an intolerably foolish,
flippant and unnecessary young man. Flippant.
Unnecessary. Foolish.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>As he said these words Candler approached
him with a dust coat of a peculiar fineness and
dignity, and he uttered the last words over his
protruded chest while Candler assisted his arms
into his sleeves.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My lord,” said Captain Douglas again, but
his resolution was deserting him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>No</em>,” said the Lord Chancellor, leaning forward
in a minatory manner while Candler pulled
down the tail of his jacket and adjusted the collar
of his overcoat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Uncle,” said Captain Douglas.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>No</em>,” said the general, with the curt decision
of a soldier, and turned exactly ninety degrees
away from him. “You little know how you have
hurt me, Alan! You little know. I couldn’t
have imagined it. The Douglas strain! False
Witness—and insult. I am sorry, my dear
Moggeridge, beyond measure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I quite understand—you are as much a
victim as myself. Quite. A more foolish
attempt—I am sorry to be in this hurry—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! You damned little fool,” said the Captain,
and advanced a step towards the perplexed
and shrinking Bealby. “You imbecile little
trickster! What do you mean by it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I didn’t mean anything—!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then suddenly the thought of Madeleine,
sweet and overpowering, came into the head of
this distraught young man. He had risked losing
her, he had slighted and insulted her, and here he
was—entangled. Here he was in a position
of nearly inconceivable foolishness, about to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>assault a dirty and silly little boy in the presence
of the Lord Chancellor and Uncle Chickney.
The world, he felt, was lost, and not well lost.
And she was lost too. Even now while he pursued
these follies she might be consoling her
wounded pride....</p>

<p class='c011'>He perceived that love is the supreme thing
in life. He perceived that he who divides his
purposes scatters his life to the four winds of
heaven. A vehement resolve to cut the whole of
this Bealby business pounced upon him. In
that moment he ceased to care for reputation,
for appearances, for the resentment of Lord
Moggeridge or the good intentions of Uncle
Chickney.</p>

<p class='c011'>He turned, he rushed out of the room. He
escaped by unparalleled gymnastics the worst
consequences of an encounter with the Lord
Chancellor’s bag which the under-butler had
placed rather tactlessly between the doors, crossed
the wide and dignified hall, and in another moment
had his engine going and was struggling to mount
his machine in the street without. His face
expressed an almost apoplectic concentration.
He narrowly missed the noses of a pair of horses
in the carriage of Lady Beach Mandarin, made
an extraordinary curve to spare a fishmonger’s
tricycle, shaved the front and completely destroyed
the gesture of that eminent actor manager,
Mr. Pomegranate, who was crossing the road in
his usual inadvertent fashion, and then he was
popping and throbbing and banging round the
corner and on his way back to the lovely and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>irresistible woman who was exerting so disastrous
an influence upon his career....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 8</h3>

<p class='c010'>The Captain fled from London in the utmost
fury and to the general danger of the public.
His heart was full of wicked blasphemies, shoutings
and self-reproaches, but outwardly he seemed
only pinkly intent. And as he crossed an open
breezy common and passed by a milestone bearing
this inscription, “To London Thirteen Miles,”
his hind tyre burst conclusively with a massive
report....</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 9</h3>

<p class='c010'>In every life there are crucial moments, turning
points, and not infrequently it is just such a
thing as this, a report, a sudden waking in the
night, a flash upon the road to Damascus, that
marks and precipitates the accumulating new.
Vehemence is not concentration. The headlong
violence of the Captain had been no expression of
a single-minded purpose, of a soul all gathered
together to an end. Far less a pursuit had it
been than a flight, a flight from his own dissensions.
And now—now he was held.</p>

<p class='c011'>After he had attempted a few plausible repairs
and found the tyre obdurate, after he had addressed
ill-chosen remonstrances to some unnamed
hearer, after he had walked some way
along the road and back in an indecision about
repair shops in some neighbouring town, the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>dregs of his resistance were spent. He perceived
that he was in the presence of a Lesson. He sat
down by the roadside, some twenty feet from the
disabled motor bicycle and, impotent for further
effort, frankly admitted himself overtaken. He
had not reckoned with punctures.</p>

<p class='c011'>The pursuing questions came clambering upon
him and would no longer be denied; who he was
and what he was and how he was, and the meaning
of this Rare Bate he had been in, and all those
deep questions that are so systematically neglected
in the haste and excitement of modern
life.</p>

<p class='c011'>In short, for the first time in many headlong
days he asked himself simply and plainly what
he thought he was up to?</p>

<p class='c011'>Certain things became clear, and so minutely
and exactly clear that it was incredible that they
had ever for a moment been obscure. Of course
Bealby had been a perfectly honest little boy,
under some sort of misconception, and of course
he ought to have been carefully coached and
prepared and rehearsed before he was put before
the Lord Chancellor. This was so manifest now
that the Captain stared aghast at his own inconceivable
negligence. But the mischief was done.
Nothing now would ever propitiate Moggeridge,
nothing now would ever reconcile Uncle Chickney.
That was—settled. But what was not settled
was the amazing disorder of his own mind. Why
had he been so negligent, what had come over
his mind in the last few weeks?</p>

<p class='c011'>And this sudden strange illumination of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>Captain’s mind went so far as perceiving that
the really important concern for him was not
the accidents of Shonts but this epilepsy of his
own will. Why now was he rushing back to
Madeleine? Why? He did not love her. He
knew he did not love her. On the whole, more
than anything else he resented her.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he was excited about her, he was so excited
that these other muddles, fluctuations, follies,
came as a natural consequence from that. Out
of this excitement came those wild floods of angry
energy that made him career about—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Like some damned Cracker,” said the Captain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For instance,” he asked himself, “<em>now!</em> what
am I going for?</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I go back she’ll probably behave like an
offended Queen. Doesn’t seem to understand
anything that does not focus on herself. Wants a
sort of Limelight Lover....</p>

<p class='c011'>“She <em>relies</em> upon exciting me!</p>

<p class='c011'>“She relies upon exciting everyone!—she’s
just a woman specialized for excitement.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And after meditating through a profound
minute upon this judgment, the Captain pronounced
these two epoch-making words: “<em>I
won’t!</em>”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 10</h3>

<p class='c010'>The Captain’s mind was now in a state of
almost violent lucidity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This sex stuff,” he said; “first I kept it under
too tight and now I’ve let it rip too loose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve been just a distracted fool, with my head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>swimming with meetings and embraces and—frills.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He produced some long impending generalizations.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not a man’s work, this Lover business.
Dancing about in a world of petticoats and powder
puffs and attentions and jealousies. Rotten
game. Played off against some other man....</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll be hanged if I am....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have to put women in their places....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Make a hash of everything if we don’t....”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then for a time the Captain meditated in
silence and chewed his knuckle. His face darkened
to a scowl. He swore as though some
thought twisted and tormented him. “Let some
other man get her! Think of her with some
other man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t care,” he said, when obviously he did.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s other women in the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A man—a man mustn’t care for <em>that</em>....</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s this or that,” said the Captain, “anyhow....”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 11</h3>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly the Captain’s mind was made up
and done.</p>

<p class='c011'>He arose to his feet and his face was firm and
tranquil and now nearer pallor than pink. He
left his bicycle and trailer by the wayside even as
Christian left his burden. He asked a passing
nurse-girl the way to the nearest railway station,
and thither he went. Incidentally, and because
the opportunity offered, he called in upon a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>cyclist’s repair shop and committed his abandoned
machinery to its keeping. He went straight to
London, changed at his flat, dined at his club, and
caught the night train for France—for France
and whatever was left of the grand manœuvres.</p>

<p class='c011'>He wrote a letter to Madeleine from the Est
train next day, using their customary endearments,
avoiding any discussion of their relations and
describing the scenery of the Seine valley and the
characteristics of Rouen in a few vivid and masterly
phrases.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If she’s worth having, she’ll understand,”
said the Captain, but he knew perfectly well she
would not understand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Geedge noted this letter among the others,
and afterwards she was much exercised by Madeleine’s
behaviour. For suddenly that lady became
extraordinarily gay and joyous in her bearing,
singing snatches of song and bubbling over
with suggestions for larks and picnics and wild
excursions. She patted Mr. Geedge on the
shoulder and ran her arm through the arm of
Professor Bowles. Both gentlemen received these
familiarities with a gawky coyness that Mrs.
Geedge found contemptible. And moreover
Madeleine drew several shy strangers into their
circle. She invited the management to a happy
participation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her great idea was a moonlight picnic. “We’ll
have a great camp-fire and afterwards we’ll dance—this
very night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But wouldn’t it be better to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To-night!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>“To-morrow perhaps Captain Douglas may
be back again. And he’s so good at all these
things.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Geedge knew better because she had seen
the French stamp on the letter, but she meant to
get to the bottom of this business, and thus it
was she said this.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve sent him back to his soldiering,” said
Madeleine serenely. “He has better things to
do.”</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 12</h3>

<p class='c010'>For some moments after the unceremonious
departure of Captain Douglas from the presence
of Lord Moggeridge, it did not occur to anyone,
it did not occur even to Bealby, that the Captain
had left his witness behind him. The general
and the Lord Chancellor moved into the hall,
and Bealby, under the sway of a swift compelling
gesture from Candler, followed modestly. The
same current swept them all out into the portico,
and while the under-butler whistled up a hansom
for the General, the Lord Chancellor, with a dignity
that was at once polite and rapid, and Candler
gravely protective and little reproving, departed.
Bealby, slowly apprehending their desertion, regarded
the world of London with perplexity and
dismay. Candler had gone. The last of the
gentlemen was going. The under-butler, Bealby
felt, was no friend. Under-butlers never are.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Chickney in the very act of entering his
cab had his coat-tail tugged. He looked enquiringly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>“Please, sir, there’s me,” said Bealby.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Chickney reflected. “Well?” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>The spirit of Bealby was now greatly abased.
His face and voice betrayed him on the verge of
tears. “I want to go ’ome to Shonts, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, my boy, go ’ome—go home, I mean,
to Shonts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’E’s gone, sir,” said Bealby....</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Chickney was a good-hearted man, and
he knew that a certain public kindliness and disregard
of appearances looks far better and is
infinitely more popular than a punctilious dignity.
He took Bealby to Waterloo in his hansom, got
him a third class ticket to Chelsome, tipped a
porter to see him safely into his train and dismissed
him in the most fatherly manner.</p>

<div class='section'></div>
<h3 class='c009'>§ 13</h3>

<p class='c010'>It was well after tea-time, Bealby felt, as he
came once more within the boundaries of the
Shonts estate.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a wiser and a graver Bealby who returned
from this week of miscellaneous adventure. He
did not clearly understand all that had happened
to him; in particular he was puzzled by the extreme
annoyance and sudden departure of Captain
Douglas from the presence of Lord Moggeridge;
but his general impression was that he had been
in great peril of dire punishment and that he had
been rather hastily and ignominiously reprieved.
The nice old gentleman with the long grey moustaches
had dismissed him to the train at last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>with a quality of benediction. But Bealby
understood now better than he had done before
that adventures do not always turn out well
for the boy hero, and that the social system has
a number of dangerous and disagreeable holes at
the bottom. He had reached the beginnings of
wisdom. He was glad he had got away from the
tramp and still gladder that he had got away from
Crayminster; he was sorry that he would never
see the beautiful lady again, and perplexed and
perplexed. And also he was interested in the
probability of his mother having toast for tea....</p>

<p class='c011'>It must, he felt, be a long time after tea-time,
quite late....</p>

<p class='c011'>He had weighed the advisability of returning
quietly to his windowless bedroom under the
stairs, putting on his little green apron and
emerging with a dutiful sang-froid as if nothing
had happened, on the one hand, or of going to
the gardens on the other. But tea—with
eatables—seemed more probable at the gardens....</p>

<p class='c011'>He was deflected from the direct route across
the park by a long deep trench, that someone had
made and abandoned since the previous Sunday
morning. He wondered what it was for. It was
certainly very ugly. And as he came out by the
trees and got the full effect of the façade, he
detected a strangely bandaged quality about
Shonts. It was as if Shonts had recently been in
a fight and got a black eye. Then he saw the
reason for this; one tower was swathed in scaffolding.
He wondered what could have happened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>to the tower. Then his own troubles resumed
their sway.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was so fortunate as not to meet his father
in the gardens, and he entered the house so meekly
that his mother did not look up from the cashmere
she was sewing. She was sitting at the
table sewing some newly dyed black cashmere.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was astonished at her extreme pallor and
the drooping resignation of her pose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother!” he said, and she looked up convulsively
and stared, stared with bright round
astonished eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m sorry, mother, I’aven’t been quite a good
steward’s-room boy, mother. If I could ’ave
another go, mother....”</p>

<p class='c011'>He halted for a moment, astonished that she
said nothing, but only sat with that strange expression
and opened and shut her mouth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Reely—I’d <em>try</em>, mother....”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
