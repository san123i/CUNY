The island method works as follows: imagine our network as an island with a complex terrain, where the height of each point on the terrain is defined by the value of a node (number of appearances). Now let us imagine that the water level around this island is rising slowly, leaving portions of the landscape underwater. When the valleys in the island are flooded, the island essentially splits into smaller islands—revealing where the highest peaks are, and making these peaks smaller. In our case, the water level will reveal highest number of appearances"

We were also able to find the movies that have high number of appearances and the actors with the most appearance. In general, what we learned from the dataset is the more appearances the same actors have in a network of movies, the wider their influence will become. This is a perfect example of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. "
