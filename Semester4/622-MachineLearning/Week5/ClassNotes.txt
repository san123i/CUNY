#How do you calculate the initial point - using PCA?

# How do you choose K value?

# When is KNN preferred?

# Are there any assumptions for KNN?
Normalization is a prereq

#Why can't we use it for regression when I know what the closer values are to my element?


KNN is an instance based classifier - not a probability based
There is no training in KNN
Better to go with K as odd to avoid stalemate
It's a lazy learner
