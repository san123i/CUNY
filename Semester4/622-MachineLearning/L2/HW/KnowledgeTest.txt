1) What is null deviance in the context of Logistic Regression?
Null deviance on logistic regression doesn't make much sense, as the value will always be 0.

2) How can we use null deviance?
Null deviance is useful in calculating how close the model is when there is only an intercept. Usually, this is the least possible score, and sets a lower limit.

3) Can the Null Deviance be negative? 
Yes, null deviance can be negative in linear regression.

4) Why is Logistic Regression, a classifier called regression?
Because in logistic regression we are going to regress the variables which are ranked.

5) Our group just completed a logistic run and generated all the betas. Now, our clients send us a revised dataset where all the labels are flipped from 0 to 1 and 1 to 0, and with NO other change. What should we do now?
Should we re-run and estimate the betas again? Explain.
