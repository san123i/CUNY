1) What is null deviance in the context of Logistic Regression?
Null deviance show how good the response variable is predicted by using just the intercept. Usually null deviance is support to act as a worst case scenario.  

2) How can we use null deviance?
Null deviance is useful in calculating how close the model is when the residuals are calculated against an intercept. 
Usually, this is the least possible score, and sets a lower limit, and helps us gauge our model's performance.

3) Can the Null Deviance be negative? 
No, the null deviance cannot be negative.

4) Why is Logistic Regression, a classifier called regression?
Because in logistic regression we are going to regress the variables which are ranked.

5) Our group just completed a logistic run and generated all the betas. Now, our clients send us a revised dataset where all the labels are flipped from 0 to 1 and 1 to 0, and with NO other change. What should we do now?
Should we re-run and estimate the betas again? Explain.
